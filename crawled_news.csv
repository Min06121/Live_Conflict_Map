List of ongoing armed conflicts,Published date not found (newspaper3k),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ongoing_armed_conflicts,"Map of ongoing armed conflicts (number of combat-related deaths in current or previous year): Major wars (10,000 or more) Minor wars (1,000–9,999) Conflicts (100–999) Skirmishes and clashes (1–99)

The following is a list of ongoing armed conflicts that are taking place around the world.

Criteria

Conflict deaths in the 17 deadliest conflicts 2015–2020

This list of ongoing armed conflicts identifies present-day conflicts and the death toll associated with each conflict. The criteria of inclusion are the following:

Armed conflicts consist in the use of armed force between two or more organized armed groups, governmental or non-governmental. [ 1 ] Interstate, intrastate and non-state armed conflicts are listed.

Fatality figures include battle-related deaths (military and civilian) as well as civilians intentionally targeted by the parties to an armed conflict. Only direct deaths resulting from violence are included for the current and previous year; excess deaths indirectly resulting from famine, disease, or disruption of services are included along with violent deaths in the cumulative fatalities count when available.

by the parties to an armed conflict. Only direct deaths resulting from violence are included for the current and previous year; excess deaths indirectly resulting from famine, disease, or disruption of services are included along with violent deaths in the cumulative fatalities count when available. Listed conflicts have at least 100 cumulative deaths in total and at least 1 death in current or in the past calendar year.

Fatality totals may be inaccurate or unavailable due to a lack of information. A figure with a plus symbol, indicates that at least that many people have died (e.g. 455+ indicates that at least 455 people have died).

Location refers to the states where the main violence takes place, not to the warring parties. Italics indicate disputed territories and unrecognized states.

refers to the states where the main violence takes place, not to the warring parties. Italics indicate disputed territories and unrecognized states. A territorial dispute or a protest movement which has not experienced deliberate and systematic deaths due to state or paramilitary violence is not considered to be an armed conflict.

List of current wars and conflicts

Major wars (10,000 or more combat-related deaths in current or previous year)

The 6 conflicts in the following list have caused at least 10,000 direct, violent deaths per year in battles between identified groups, in the current or previous calendar year.[2]

Minor wars (1,000–9,999 combat-related deaths in current or previous year)

The 10 conflicts in the following list have caused at least 1,000 and fewer than 10,000 direct, violent deaths in the current or previous calendar year.[2] Conflicts causing at least 1,000 deaths in one calendar year are considered wars by the Uppsala Conflict Data Program.[35]

Conflicts (100–999 combat-related deaths in current or previous year)

The 16 conflicts in the following list have caused at least 100, and fewer than 1,000, direct, violent deaths in the current or previous calendar year.

Skirmishes and clashes (fewer than 100 combat-related deaths in current and previous year)

The 10 conflicts in the following list have caused fewer than 100 direct, violent deaths in the current or previous calendar year.

This is, in numbers, the most affected region: more than 45 armed conflicts are currently taking place throughout the Middle East and North Africa in the following territories: Cyprus, Egypt, Iraq, Israel, Libya, Morocco, Palestine, Syria, Turkey, Yemen and Western Sahara.

The majority are non-international (NIACs), involving a multitude of armed non-state actors and foreign interventions by Western powers, Russia, and neighbouring countries – except for the NIACs taking place in Egypt and Turkey.

‘Syria is the most affected country in the region. Several multiple and overlapping NIACs are taking place in the country – involving numerous armed groups who fight against the government and against each other –, along with two military occupations and three international armed conflicts’ explains Dr Chiara Redealli, Research Fellow at the Geneva Academy.

Countries Currently at War / Countries at War 2025,Published date not found (newspaper3k),https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/countries-currently-at-war,"The Oxford English Dictionary defines “war” as: (1) A state of armed conflict between different countries or different groups within a country; (2) a state of competition or hostility between different people or groups, or (3) a sustained campaign against an undesirable situation or activity. There are many possible reasons for war to begin between—or more often, within—nations. Among these are economic gain, territorial gain, religion, nationalism, civil war, and political revolution. Often, countries’ leaders become primary motivators of conflict by instigating a territorial dispute, trying to control another country’s natural resources, or exercising authoritarian power over people. Countries subject to prolonged conflict can become war-torn countries that require many decades to rebuild their infrastructure, economy, and other functions.

Not all wars are formalized with official declarations of war between combatants. Conversely, not every ongoing armed conflict is classified as a war. This article will use the Uppsala Conflict Data Program definition, which described war as “a state-based conflict or dyad which reaches at least 1000 battle-related deaths in a specific calendar year.” Fatality figures include any combatants killed in action as well as any civilians who were deliberately killed (for example, by bombings or other attacks).

The 2022 Russia/Ukraine Conflict

On February 24, 2022, the Russian Federation began a military invasion of Ukraine, escalating a conflict that had been simmering since Russia’s 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula. After officially recognizing the separatist Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk on February 21, 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin sent troops into Ukraine on what he termed a “peacekeeping” mission, which escalated to a large-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.

Military Action in the Russo-Ukrainian Conflict

The initial attacks were composed of missile volleys, soon followed by ground troops and armored units which entered Ukraine from both Russia and Belarus and appeared to be targeting Ukraine’s capital city of Kiev. By Feb. 24, 2022,, Russian forces had taken control of the Chernobyl nuclear power facility. As of the evening of Feb. 25, 2022,, Russian forces had also overtaken an airfield near Kyiv and were expected to take control of the city within days, if not hours.

However, those expectations proved inaccurate. The Ukrainian people, urged to resist by President Volodymyr Zelensky, fought with great conviction and effectiveness. The frozen ground began to thaw, creating muddy, boggy soil that limited the ability of tanks and other heavy armored vehicles. Russia also had great difficulty keeping supply lines running smoothly—a concern amplified by the fact that, according to some reports, Russia’s ground forces entered Ukraine carrying only a three-day supply of fuel. Many Russian tanks ran out of fuel and were abandoned. Moreover, reports came of Russian soldiers who chose to surrender rather than fire upon Ukrainians, whom they regarded as countrymen (because Ukraine is a former Soviet Republic). Together, these factors delayed what Russia reportedly planned to be a swift takeover.

As of Sept. 12, 2022, Kyiv still had not fallen. Conversely, as time passed, the war began to turn more and more in Ukraine’s favor. The United States and other allies offered significant military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine while also imposing all manner of trade boycotts and other economic and political penalties upon Russia. Morale among Russian troops continued to decrease, and Ukrainian counterattacks, particularly in early September, were successful in reclaiming large portions of territory previously occupied by Russia.

Initial Developments in the Russo-Ukrainian Conflict

In the face of Ukraine’s initial stronger-than-expected resistance, Russia escalated its efforts. It had reportedly broken cease-fire agreements, admitted to launching thermobaric rockets, hypersonic missiles, and banned anti-personnel mines and cluster munitions, the uses of which may be considered war crimes. Russia had also begun attacking civilian targets including a known evacuation route and a maternity hospital and other health care facilities (which are also war crimes). Despite these escalated tactics, as well as looming shortages of food and water in Ukrainian towns such as Kherson, Kharkiv, and Sumy, Ukraine launched a counteroffensive that seemed by March 22, 2022 to have reclaimed some of the territory Russia had occupied, most notably the city of Makariv, west of Kyiv. As of May 2, 2022, Ukrainian forces were continuing to regain territory.

As of May 5, 2022, more than 5.5 million Ukranians had fled the country, seeking refuge predominantly in Poland (more than 3 million refugees) but also in Hungary, Slovakia, and other European countries—including, somewhat paradoxically, Russia, where many Ukranians have family. More than 7 million more are believed to be displaced inside the country. On March 25, 2022, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) estimated that one out of every two Ukrainian children had been displaced by the ongoing war, and the UN has gone on record stating the Ukraine refugee crisis is “the fastest and largest displacement of people in Europe since World War II.”

By March 15, 2022, the Ukranian city of Mariupol was deeply engaged with Russian forces. Mariupol’s mayor told news organizations that the Russians were intent upon destroying the city and had dropped more than 100 bombs on Mariupol in a single day. Multiple Ukrainian officials have further claimed the Russians were holding hostage the doctors and patients of one of the city’s hospitals. It is estimated that 350,000 to 400,000 Ukrainians remain in Mariupol, where shortages of food and water are becoming an increasing problem, as humanitarian aid has been slow to reach the city, reportedly blocked by Russian forces. The Russians have also been accused of agreeing to “evacuation routes” meant to offer civilians free passage out of besieged cities, but then shelling those routes with artillery. Russian forces have supplemented the land-based artillery shelling the city with additional bombardment from warships in the Sea of Azov. Satellite photos released on March 30, 2022, show entire city blocks flattened by artillery and missile bombardment.

Russia has also been accused of forcibly relocating captured Ukrainians to Russia, which would be a violation of the Geneva Conventions. Russian forces have reportedly stolen, detained, and even redirected evacuation buses. Estimates in late March suggested the number of Ukrainians abducted and taken to Russia may have been as many as 40,000, including thousands of children. Many were reportedly forced to choose between going to Russia or being killed. By May 2, 2022, it was believed that 40,000 residents from Mariupol alone had been deported, and the Russian government openly stated it had “evacuated” more than a million people, including 200,000 children.

On March 16, 2022, U.S. defense officials reported increased Russian naval activity in the waters near the city of Odessa, located on Ukraine’s southern coastline, which would seem to indicate the possibility of an amphibious attack from Russia. Odessa is the last Ukrainian port city still controlled by Ukraine. The U.S. also announced $800M USD in defense assistance for Ukraine, including more than 600 Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, which could help fend off the Russian bombing raids. Thus far, the U.S. and NATO have not implemented a no-fly zone over the Ukraine, despite Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s request.

In Mariupol, evidence emerged that Russian forces had bombed a theater where hundreds of Ukrainian civilians had taken shelter—and had written the word “children” in large letters in the parking lot outside. The fate of the theater’s inhabitants was unknown, as the entrance had become blocked by rubble. However, on March 17, 2022, it was announced that at least some of the up to 1,200 people sheltering inside had survived and begun to emerge from the rubble. A day later on March 18, 2022, 130 people had been pulled from the rubble, but hundreds more remained buried (it was revealed on March 25, 2022 that an estimated 300 people had died, but some 600 had survived).

A similar event seems to have occurred on March 20, 2022, when Russian forces bombed an art school that was being used as a shelter by up to 400 Ukrainians. Despite these demoralizing attacks, Ukraine rejected Russia’s demand to surrender Mariupol by the morning on Monday, March 21, 2022. Increasing evidence exists of mass graves in Mariupol and other locations, and that Russian troops may be executing POWs.

Throughout the conflict, Russian President Vladimir Putin has maintained that Russia is the victim and Ukraine is a stealth aggressor, claiming that Ukraine has secret nuclear and biological weapons programs and that it harbors neo-Nazis (a clear reference to Ukraine’s admittedly ultranationalist Azov battalion) who must be eradicated. While Putin offered no proof of any nuclear or biological weapons in Ukraine, U.S. officials warned of the possibility of “false flag” operations in which Russian forces would launch chemical weapons themselves in an attempt to frame Ukraine. Around March 20, 2022, NATO and U.S. officials also warned that Belarus, which lies to Ukraine’s north, may soon join the war on behalf of Russia.

On March 18, 2022, Russian missiles struck the city of Lviv, which lies just 40 miles from Ukraine’s border with Poland. In response, the Polish prime minister announced he would submit a proposal to NATO to launch a peacekeeping mission in the Ukraine.

By March 25, 2022, it was estimated that Russia had launched 1,250 missiles into Ukraine, including toward population centers such as the cities of Mariupol and Kyiv, as well as high-value targets such as airstrips and fuel depots. Ukraine also announced that the Ukrainian Air Force command center had been struck by cruise missiles, causing considerable damage. However, it was further estimated that Russia’s supplies of certain types of missile were running low. On March 27, 2022, Russia confirmed it had struck two fuel depots with missiles, one near the city of Lviv and the other near Kyiv.

On March 29, 2022, Russia announced it would “drastically reduce” its attacks on the cities of Kyiv and Chernihiv as part of ongoing peace talks between Russia and Ukraine. U.S. intelligence confirmed that a small number of Russian forces had indeed moved away from Kyiv, though many officials from both the U.S. and notably Russia were quick to clarify that this was a simple repositioning of Russian forces rather than the first step toward a larger cease-fire.

This warning would prove accurate, as Russian forces regrouped and soon intensified efforts to take over Ukraine’s southern and eastern regions. Moreover, the mayor of Chernihiv maintained that Russian attacks increased after the announcement rather than decreasing. Meanwhile, reports began to surface that Russian troops were refusing orders and that advisors to Russian leader Vladimir Putin were misleading him about the war’s progress.

Over the following days, Russian forces did retreat from Kyiv and Chernihiv. However, the retreat revealed substantial evidence that Russian troops had conducted significant war crimes during their occupation of Ukrainian territories. The existence of mass graves and clear signs that civilians had been targeted, abused, and executed in areas such as the city of Bucha incited a new round of condemnation of Russia’s actions from the international community. By April 15, 2022, more than 900 civilian bodies had been discovered in areas of Kyiv that had been occupied by Russian forces. As a result of these discoveries, multiple countries have accused Russia of genocide.. Russian soldiers have also been accused of using rape to break Ukrainians’ morale.

On April 14, 2022, the Russian guided-missile cruiser Moskva sank in the Black Sea. Ukraine claimed it had struck the ship with a missile, while Russia claimed the sinking was due to an onboard fire that set off stored ammunition. Whatever the true cause, the loss of the Moskva, a flagship of the Russian fleet, is said to have triggered “increasingly hostile” conflict in Ukraine’s southern regions. President Zelensky and other governmental officials also reiterated public warnings that Russian President Vladimir Putin could quite possibly deploy chemical or tactical nuclear weapons if the conflict continues to favor Ukraine.

Political Fallout of the Russian Invasion of Ukraine

The majority of the world’s countries, as well as organizations including NATO, the European Union, and the Council of Europe, have strongly condemned Russia’s actions. Many countries have sent military supplies and humanitarian aid to Ukraine, but have not yet sent troops to assist in the country’s defense. On March 16, 2022, the International Court of Justice ruled 13-2 that Russia must immediately cease its military operations in Ukraine.

The sentiments of the Russian people as a whole are difficult to ascertain, as the Russian government heavily censors information and blocks social media and news websites. Russia has also made it illegal for the press to offer any opinion or information that does not directly support the highly partisan and factually inaccurate official government stance on the invasion. As a result, many press outlets are fleeing the country or shutting down altogether.

The United States, Germany, and several other nations also imposed massive economic sanctions against Russia, such as boycotting the purchase of Russian oil and wheat and locking Russian banks out of the financial network SWIFT, thereby limiting their ability to conduct international transactions. Supply chain shortages caused by these sanctions, as well as the conflict itself, have sent the prices of gasoline, natural gas, wheat, and certain other products (particularly those produced by Russia or Ukraine), to record highs in many places around the globe.

However, the greatest financial impact is happening in Russia itself, where the ruble is plummeting in value and the already struggling economy is undergoing tremendous strain. Many countries have also levied sanctions against Putin himself, as well as various other high-level Russian politicians and oligarchs. China, notably, has been reticent to criticize Russia’s actions and has not imposed any sanctions. On March 25, 2022, Putin instructed Russia’s gas importers to accept payments only in Russian rubles, a move intended to increase the flailing value of Russia’s currency. The move was widely rejected by countries including France and Germany.

On March 15, 2022, Russia announced that it was withdrawing from the Council of Europe, a humanitarian organization that had suspended Russia’s membership upon its initial invasion of Ukraine. The 47-nation council instead moved to expel Russia on March 15, 2022. Russia also announced that it had chosen to sanction U.S. President Joe Biden, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, and several other high-ranking U.S. officials. The sanctions appeared to be largely symbolic, however, as Psaki noted half-jokingly that the U.S. officials had no Russian vacations planned and no Russian bank accounts they would no longer be able to access. On April 15, 2022, Russia officially protested the United States’ supplying of weapons and ammunition to Ukraine.

Peace talks between Russia and Ukraine continued as of March 17, 2022, with one of the key points being Russia’s insistence that Ukraine not join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). On March 27, 2022, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky stated that Ukraine would be willing to agree to remain neutral and reverse plans to join NATO. However, Zelensky added, demilitarization and “denazification”—a term many experts feel Putin is using as a baseless excuse to invade—would not be on the table. However, peace talks continued and arguably contributed to Russia’s March 29, 2022 announcement that it would de-escalate its attacks on the northern cities of Kyiv (Ukraine’s capital) and Chernihiv.

On April 04, 2022, the United Nations General Assembly voted to remove Russia from the United Nations’ Human Rights Council. Russia remained a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, however, a situation that many, including Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, have claimed undermines the organization’s credibility and effectiveness.

On April 22, 2022, Russian officials revealed that Russia’s goal was to take control of the southeastern portion of Ukraine. Annexing this region would establish a land bridge between Russia and the Crimean peninsula, which it had previously annexed in 2014.

Countries Currently at War (as of September 2022)

Category: 10,000+ casualties in 2022

Myanmar

Type: Civil War

2022 casualties (estimate): 13,646

Conflict between the various ethnic factions in Myanmar began in 1948, the year the country gained independence from the UK, and has continued in varying degrees ever since, making this the longest civil war in the world. While the conflict waned briefly from 2011-2021 amid ongoing political reform, a 2021 military coup plunged the country back into violence. ACLED estimates that Myanmar endured 11,000 casualties in 2021 and more than 13,000 in the first eight months of 2022.

Russia [also involved: Ukraine]

Type: Invasion (aggressor) 2022 casualties (estimate): 15,000-20,000

Estimates for the number of Russian troops lost thus far in the country’s “special military operation” in Ukraine vary widely, with Russia claiming a mere 5,000 casualties and Ukraine claiming 50,000. In late July 2022, the US military estimated 15,000 Russian troops killed and 45,000 wounded, and an August estimate raised the collective number to 70,000-80,000 for both KIA and wounded.

Ukraine [also involved: Russia]

Type: Invasion (defender) 2022 casualties: 13,528 military (estimated), 5,718 civilians (confirmed)

Although the Russo-Ukrainian War began in 2014 with Russia’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula, the situation escalated tremendously with Russia’s invasion of the Ukrainian mainland in February of 2022. Casualty estimates have been complicated by the facts that millions of Ukrainians have become homeless refugees and that Russia has deported thousands of prisoners of war (both soldiers and civilians) back to Russia. Both of these conditions make casualty tallies difficult to discern.

Category: 1,000 to 10,000 casualties in 2023

Countries in Which War Casualties Fell Below 10,000 in 2022

Afghanistan

Type: Civil War/Terrorist Insurgency

2022 casualties (ACLED estimate): 2,710

The war in Afghanistan has been on and off since 1978. The most recent phase began in 2001 and has primarily revolved around U.S. and U.N. forces and allied Afghan troops fighting Taliban insurgents. According to the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), there were 30,936 confirmed fatalities in 2020 alone. The US/UN withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 signaled that particular conflict, but the Taliban immediately retook control of the country and war between the Taliban and other factions, including ISIL-K, which bombed the airport in Kabul during U.S. evacuations, continues. The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED) estimates that Afghanistan has experienced more than 2,700 casualties in 2022.

Ethiopia [also involved: Eritrea]

Type: Civil War

2022 casualties (ACLED estimate): 4,790

Tension between clashing political parties in Ethiopia escalated into a violent civil war in November 2020. Eritrea, which borders Ethiopia to the north, has also sent troops into the conflict. The violence has spilled over into neighboring countries, with isolated skirmishes taking place in Sudan and Somalia. Named the “Tigray War”, after the region in which it began, the war had resulted in more than 9,000 documented casualties (though some sources estimate more than 50,000) by September 2021. Reports indicate war crimes are common.

Mexico

Type: Drug War

2022 casualties (ACLED estimate): 5,393

The Mexican Drug War is an ongoing conflict between the Mexican government and multiple powerful and violent drug trafficking cartels. It is estimated that the war on drugs has led to at least 350,000 deaths—with more than 72,000 people still missing—from January 2006 to May 2021.

Yemen [also involved: Saudi Arabia]

Type: Civil War

2022 casualties (ACLED estimate): 5,548

The Yemeni Civil War began in September 2014 when the Houthi armed movement took control of Sanaa, the capital city and seat of the existing government, led by President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi. Both factions claim to be the official Yemeni government. Saudi Arabia intervened in support of Hadi in early 2015, leading a coalition of Asian and African countries, with intelligence and logistical support from the United States. ACLED has counted more than 140,000 fatalities since the start of the war, including nearly 20,000 in 2020 alone.

In April 2022, the two sides in this conflict agreed to a two-month truce, which could be extended indefinitely (two months at a time) into the future. As of September 2022, the truce has been extended multiple times. While the truce has not always been followed—more than 2000 violations (resulting in 350+ fatalities) have been recorded since its adoption—it has nonetheless decreased the level of violence in the country, which saw more than 23,000 deaths in 2021.",,https://worldpopulationreview.com/og-image.png

This war is different. Although men and machines are also clashing in this one, the global public can this time follow the developments in nearly real time, unlike in past conflicts. At the NZZ, too, we are using the flood of information reaching us from Ukraine to give you the most up-to-date picture of the situation possible. Our interactive map above depicts recent events, territorial gains and losses, satellite imagery, and the position of Russian troops. It is an attempt to map the reality of war.

However, reality is always more complex than what can be represented on a map. Maps always show only a certain point of view, and can only approximate reality. Therefore, we want to be clear here about how our map has been created, so readers can understand what it says and what it does not.

The short answer: anything relevant to understanding the war that we have been able to verify. The detailed answer, on the other hand, is more complex and – because war is constantly changing – in a constant state of flux.

«Relevant» to us means, for example, the locations in which combat operations are taking place; or strategically important targets that have been attacked or captured such as airports, power plants, transmission towers or bridges. We do not report the destruction of individual buildings unless the attack has symbolic value or has claimed an exceptionally large number of victims. For example: In the embattled city of Mariupol, a theater with hundreds of civilians sheltering in its basements was destroyed.

We do not show deaths, events that serve (Russian or Ukrainian) propaganda, or those that violate international law. For example, we do not show pictures in which captured soldiers are recognizable.

» Read more about when and why we publish images of dead people here.

We record on the map only those attacks that we have been able to substantiate through multiple independent sources. Our sources include Twitter, Facebook, Telegram and news agencies. We also include communications from local authorities in our research, but we treat this information with caution.

We check every picture and video to see if it was taken at the specified location and if the specified time is plausible. For verification purposes we refer to satellite images or Google Street View images, but we also rely on other reliable research networks (such as Bellingcat) or private persons (so-called Osint specialists, more about this here).

» Read more about how Osint experts verify events.

» Read more about how you can recognize fake news on social media yourself.

We collect current news on a daily basis, even on weekends. In some cases, we are aware of events shortly after they occur, but are unable to verify them until the following day, using further material.

There is no official information from the Ukrainian or Russian side regarding which areas are under whose control. And if such information was provided, it would not be reliable. Maps have always been misused for political purposes (China, for example, depicts maritime areas as belonging to China in order to strengthen its claim to them).

At the same time, the nature of warfare has also changed. Attackers do not drive across forests and meadows with a broad front, seeking to annex square meter after square meter, as they did in World War II, for example. Instead, combat operations focus on strategically important roads, cities and facilities. Maps showing large areas held by Russian troops therefore often do not represent the actual influence of a warring party.

This is illustrated by the following example. The first map is from the Ukrainian organization Liveuamap (more on that later). Instead of entire areas, the creators often mark only individual streets as being held by Russian troops. Information provided by the American Institute for the Study of War appears to show far greater Russian successes for the same day. On the latest map published by Russian newspaper Readovka, areas marked in color as the «war zone» give the impression that large parts of eastern Ukraine are under Russian control.

For our map we use data from Liveuamap. This organization emerged in 2014 in Ukraine during the annexation of Crimea. Since then, the staff has dealt with various conflicts both in and outside Europe. The NZZ has also relied on its data for other conflicts.

We rely on information from Henry Schlottman, a former U.S. Army analyst. Using known troop positions before the war began, pictures of (destroyed) Russian war equipment, information from prisoners and other public data, he is able to record the approximate position of each unit. Despite all this information, the data remain approximations.

The Russian army relies on so-called battalion tactical groups (BTGs). A BTG consists of various individual units and is capable of performing tasks without additional support. It is a central organizational unit in the Russian army and typically consists of infantry, tank companies, artillery, air defense, logistics and other support units, for example.

Yes, the map is constantly being adapted and expanded to meet changing needs.

Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, May 24, 2025 Click here to read the full report with maps Daria Novikov, Angelica Evans, Olivia Gibson, Anna Harvey, and Frederick W. Kagan with Nate Trotter May 24, 2025, 5:15 pm ET Russian forces conducted one of the largest combined drone and missile strikes of the war against Ukraine on the night of May 23 to 24, but used fewer missiles than in previous large-scale combined strikes. The Ukrainian Air Force reported on May 24 that Russian forces launched 14 Iskander-M ballistic missiles from the directions of Taganrog, Rostov Oblast; Yeysk, Krasnodar Krai; Bryansk City; and occupied Crimea; and 250 Shahed and decoy drones from the directions of Bryansk, Kursk, and Oryol cities; Millerovo, Rostov Oblast; Shatalovo, Smolensk Oblast; and Primorsko-Akhtarsk, Krasnodar Krai.[1] The Ukrainian Air Force reported that Ukrainian forces shot down six Iskander-M missiles and 128 Shahed drones, and that 117 drones were “lost in location.” Ukrainian officials reported that the Russian strike heavily targeted Kyiv City and that drones and missiles also struck Odesa, Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, and Zaporizhia oblasts.[2] The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) claimed prior to the strike on March 23 that Russian forces would respond ""adequately"" to recent Ukrainian strikes against Russian positions and defense facilities.[3] Russian forces have significantly intensified their nightly attacks against Ukraine over the last five months and have conducted several of the largest strikes of the entire war since January 2025. Russian forces appear to be reducing their use of cruise missiles, indicating that increased Russian drone production and innovations to long-range drones and related strike tactics are providing Russian forces with a cheaper alternative to cruise missiles.[4] Ukrainian Air Force Spokesperson Colonel Yurii Ihnat stated on May 24 that Ukrainian forces are struggling to use Patriot air defense systems to down modified Russian Iskander-M ballistic missiles due to recent Russian improvements, including enhancements that enable the missile to change trajectory and perform maneuvers rather than flying in a straight line.[5] Ukrainian aviation expert Anatoliy Khrapchynskyi reported on February 11 that Russian forces had reduced their use of Kh-101 and Kh-555 cruise missiles and were increasingly using Kh-59 and Kh-69 cruise missiles.[6] ISW has observed Russian forces rarely using Kh-101, Kh-55, and Kh-555 cruise missiles against Ukraine since February 2025 and infrequently using Kh-59 and Kh-69 cruise missiles since March 2025. Russian forces most recently used almost 60 cruise missiles against Ukraine on April 24, but Russia typically uses large numbers of Shahed and decoy drones to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses in nightly strikes and has recently relied on small numbers of ballistic missiles to conduct more targeted strikes against Ukrainian cities.[7] Russian forces appear to be increasing their use of long-range drones and decreasing their use of cruise missiles in strikes against Ukraine, possibly to conserve the fixed-wing airframes that Russian forces use to launch cruise missiles. Ukraine and Russia conducted a second round of prisoner-of-war (POW) exchanges on May 24 as part of a larger 1,000-for-1,000 exchange agreed upon during recent bilateral negotiations in Istanbul. Ukrainian and Russian officials announced that Ukraine and Russia each exchanged 307 POWs.[8] Ukrainian officials reported that Ukrainian POWs included those serving in the Ukrainian Army, Naval Forces, State Border Service, and the National Guard.[9] Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky noted that Ukraine and Russia have each exchanged a total of 697 soldiers and civilians over the last two days. The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) reported that Russian authorities are transporting the Russian servicemembers to Belarus for rehabilitation.[10] Russian officials will reportedly submit a draft document of their conditions for peace in Ukraine following the conclusion of the POW exchanges, although Russia's conditions are unlikely to be anything short of Ukraine's full surrender. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha stated on May 23 that Ukraine expects Russia to present a draft proposal for an unconditional ceasefire agreement after the third and final POW exchange on May 25.[11] Sybiha added that Ukraine welcomes the participation of US President Donald Trump and European leaders in future peace talks and that Ukraine has not ruled out the possibility of holding a meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov stated on May 23 that Russia would be ready to present Ukraine with Russia's draft document on a ""long-term settlement of the crisis"" as soon as the POW exchange is completed.[12] Lavrov's statement highlights the Kremlin's ongoing efforts to force Ukraine and the West to begin long-term peace negotiations without an active ceasefire in place, in contrast to US, Ukrainian, and European efforts to first secure an unconditional ceasefire agreement prior to any long-term peace talks. ISW continues to assess that Russia remains committed to pursuing demands that amount to nothing short of Ukraine's full capitulation and that Russia will continue to pursue this objective so long as Putin believes Russia can militarily defeat Ukraine.[13] Russian forces have significantly expanded their salient southwest of Kostyantynivka in recent weeks and established sufficient positions to launch an offensive operation toward Kostyantynivka from the south or to support the envelopment of Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad from the northeast in the coming weeks and months. Geolocated footage published on May 23 indicates that Russian forces recently advanced south of Popiv Yar (west of Toretsk) and seized the fields southeast of the settlement.[14] A Russian milblogger claimed on May 23 that elements of the 150th Motorized Rifle Division (8th Combined Arms Army [CAA], Southern Military District [SMD]) participated in the advance near Popiv Yar and that Russian forces also advanced north and south of Oleksandropil (southeast of Popiv Yar).[15] Another Russian milblogger claimed that Russian forces are advancing further into Poltavka (north of Popiv Yar) and toward Rusyn Yar (northeast of Popiv Yar).[16] Another Russian milblogger claimed that elements of the 33rd Motorized Rifle Regiment (20th Motorized Rifle Division, 8th CAA) are advancing near Novoolenivka (east of Popiv Yar).[17] Russian milbloggers claimed that Russian forces have seized most of Romanivka (southeast of Popiv Yar) and that Russian forces are eliminating the remaining Ukrainian positions south and southeast of Zorya (southeast of Popiv Yar).[18] The Russian salient southwest of Kostyantynivka is likely sufficient to support a future Russian offensive operation toward Kostyantynivka or Pokrovsk, but Russian forces will have to make further advances from Chasiv Yar and Toretsk and west of Pokrovsk before Russian forces will pose a significant threat to either of these towns. ISW has observed geolocated footage indicating that Russian forces have advanced roughly 14 kilometers from the southwestern outskirts of Kostyantynivka at their closest point in this salient. Russian forces will be able to leverage this salient to advance further along the T-0504 Pokrovsk-Kostyantynivka highway from the south toward Kostyantynivka as Russian forces contend with Ukrainian defenses west of and along the Kleban-Byk reservoir. Russian forces must eliminate the remaining Ukrainian pocket southwest of Toretsk and force Ukrainian forces to withdraw north of the Kleban-Byk reservoir before Russian forces will be able to advance further along the H-20 Donetsk City-Kostyantynivka highway to support future advances up to the southern outskirts of Kostyantynivka. ISW previously noted that Russian forces have struggled to break out of Chasiv Yar and Toretsk, which has likely complicated Russia’s plans for an offensive against Kostyantynivka and the wider Ukrainian fortress belt.[19] Russian advances in Chasiv Yar have been slow over the last year, and Russian forces have yet to significantly reinforce the Russian grouping in this area to facilitate further advances. Russian forces will have to break through Ukrainian defenses and advance south and southwest of Chasiv Yar before Russian forces will be able to threaten Kostyantynivka from the northeast. Russia reinforced its force grouping in Toretsk in early 2025, but Russian forces continue to struggle to advance through the contested ""gray zone"" that Ukrainian and Russian drone operators have created within Toretsk and immediately west of Toretsk. Russian forces must advance in the fields north, northwest, and west of Toretsk and seize positions further along the T-0516 Toretsk-Kostyantynivka highway before Russian forces can launch a serious offensive operation against Kostyantynivka. The Russian salient southwest of Kostyantynivka is therefore only one of the three necessary areas where Russian forces must make further advances in order to seriously threaten Kostyantynivka. Russian forces must advance further west of Pokrovsk if they intend to envelop Pokrovsk and avoid fighting through the town's urban areas in Summer 2025. Russian forces largely abandoned efforts to expand their salient southwest of Pokrovsk when Ukrainian forces conducted a series of counterattacks south and southwest of Pokrovsk in February 2025. Russian forces have not reintensified this effort and have instead prioritized advances further southwest of Pokrovsk toward Novopavlivka in March, April, and May 2025. Russian forces must reintensify their efforts to advance west of Pokrovsk toward Hryshyne if Russian forces intend to force Ukrainian forces to withdraw from Pokrovsk under threat of envelopment. Russian forces have recently intensified assaults immediately southeast and south of Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad, and Russian forces may be preparing to attack into the towns themselves to support the envelopment effort, as Russian forces did in Avdiivka, Vuhledar, Kurakhove, and Velyka Novosilka over the last year. Russian forces will also have to contend with ongoing Ukrainian counterattacks and drone operations throughout the Kostyantynivka and Pokrovsk directions in future offensive operations. ISW continues to assess that Russia is unlikely to have sufficient manpower, materiel, and operational planning capabilities to conduct both an envelopment of Pokrovsk and a significant offensive operation toward Kostyantynivka in the coming months and will likely have to prioritize one direction.[20] Key Takeaways: Russian forces conducted one of the largest combined drone and missile strikes of the war against Ukraine on the night of May 23 to 24, but used fewer missiles than in previous large-scale combined strikes.

Ukraine and Russia conducted a second round of prisoner-of-war (POW) exchanges on May 24 as part of a larger 1,000-for-1,000 exchange agreed upon during recent bilateral negotiations in Istanbul.

Russian officials will reportedly submit a draft document of their conditions for peace in Ukraine following the conclusion of the POW exchanges, although Russia's conditions are unlikely to be anything short of Ukraine's full surrender.

Russian forces have significantly expanded their salient southwest of Kostyantynivka in recent weeks and established sufficient positions to launch an offensive operation toward Kostyantynivka from the south or to support the envelopment of Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad from the northeast in the coming weeks and months.

The Russian salient southwest of Kostyantynivka is likely sufficient to support a future Russian offensive operation toward Kostyantynivka or Pokrovsk, but Russian forces will have to make further advances from Chasiv Yar and Toretsk and west of Pokrovsk before Russian forces will pose a significant threat to either of these towns.

Russian forces recently advanced near Lyman, Toretsk, and Novopavlivka.



Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, May 23, 2025 Click here to read the full report with maps Angelica Evans, Nicole Wolkov, Olivia Gibson, Grace Mappes, and Frederick W. Kagan with Nate Trotter May 23, 2025, 4:45 pm ET Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov demanded that any future peace agreement in Ukraine include conditions to prevent the election and establishment of future pro-Western governments in Ukraine. Lavrov insisted on May 23 that any peace agreement must include conditions preventing the ""repetition of what brought putschists to power through a bloody revolution,"" referring to Ukraine's 2014 Euromaidan protests and the Revolution of Dignity, which drove out Ukraine's former pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych.[1] Lavrov also reiterated Russian President Vladimir Putin's repeated claim that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is not the legitimate leader of Ukraine and claimed that Russia could negotiate with the leadership of Ukraine's Verkhovna Rada (parliament) instead of Zelensky. Russian officials often deliberately misread the Ukrainian Constitution to claim that Zelensky's government is illegitimate since Ukraine did not hold presidential elections in 2024, although the Ukrainian Constitution and law prohibit the government from holding elections during times of martial law and external aggression.[2] Russian officials have repeatedly characterized Ukraine's Euromaidan protests and Revolution of Dignity as a ""coup,"" and leverage this narrative to reinforce Russia's claims that the current Ukrainian government is not legitimate and thus cannot negotiate with Russia.[3] Lavrov's statement is also an explicit demand for regime change in Ukraine as a condition of any future peace agreement – a demand that Russian officials routinely make under the guise of demands for ""denazification"" in Ukraine.[4] Russian officials will likely falsely frame any future pro-Western government in Ukraine as inheriting the illegitimacy of all Ukrainian governments since 2014 and set conditions to claim that any agreement that Russia concludes with Ukraine is non-binding. Lavrov also rejected US President Donald Trump's recent suggestion that the Vatican could host negotiations on Russia's war against Ukraine.[5] Lavrov claimed that negotiations in the Vatican would be ""unrealistic"" and that it would be ""uncomfortable"" for the representatives of ""two Orthodox countries"" to meet in the Vatican.[6] Ukraine and Russia conducted a 390-for-390 prisoner-of-war (POW) and civilian exchange on May 23 as part of a larger 1,000-for-1,000 exchange agreed upon during recent bilateral negotiations in Istanbul. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that Ukraine and Russia exchanged 390 Ukrainians for 390 Russians in the first stage of the 1,000-for-1,000 exchange and that Ukraine expects the swaps to continue on May 24 and 25.[7] The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) claimed that Russia and Ukraine conducted a 270-for-270 POW exchange and a 120-for-120 civilian exchange.[8] Russian forces reportedly recently executed more Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) on the battlefield. The Donetsk Oblast Prosecutor's Office stated on May 23 that it launched an investigation into reports of Russian forces executing two POWs in the Pokrovsk direction on May 22.[9] The prosecutor's office reported that Russian forces captured, disarmed, and executed two of four Ukrainian soldiers conducting a combat operation near Udachne (southwest of Pokrovsk). The prosecutor's office reported that the status of the other two Ukrainian soldiers is unknown. There has been a sharp increase in credible reports and footage of Russian forces executing Ukrainian POWs throughout 2024 and 2025.[10] ISW continues to assess that Russian military commanders are either complicit in or directly enabling their subordinates to conduct systemic executions in direct violation of international law.[11] Russian President Vladimir Putin approved an experimental application to monitor migrants, likely in an effort to placate Russian ultranationalist demands while continuing to leverage migrants to support force generation and mitigate labor shortages. Putin signed a law on May 23 allowing Moscow City and Oblast authorities to introduce an experimental mobile application to register and track migrants.[12] The law forces some populations of migrants to register with Russian authorities and provide their location to the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) through a mobile application. Russian state outlets reported that Russian authorities may deport migrants who attempt to conceal their location.[13] This experimental application system will begin on September 1 and will last until September 1, 2029. The official Russian government newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta suggested that Russia would extend these registration and tracking systems throughout Russia should the test in Moscow City and Oblast prove successful.[14] Russian Investigative Committee Head Alexander Bastrykin stated on May 20 at the St. Petersburg International Legal Forum that the Investigative Committee recently created a new division for investigating crimes that migrants commit in Russia.[15] ISW continues to assess that Putin is prioritizing leveraging migrants to mitigate ongoing labor shortages and to support force generation efforts, despite ongoing complaints from Russian ultranationalists advocating for the Kremlin to impose harsher restrictions on migrants.[16] Putin may be attempting to placate Russian ultranationalists by approving select harsher restrictions that ultimately allow Russia to better monitor migrants to leverage them for labor and force generation. Key Takeaways: Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov demanded that any future peace agreement in Ukraine include conditions to prevent the election and establishment of future pro-Western governments in Ukraine.

Ukraine and Russia conducted a 390-for-390 prisoner-of-war (POW) and civilian exchange on May 23 as part of a larger 1,000-for-1,000 exchange agreed upon during recent bilateral negotiations in Istanbul.

Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment May 22, 2025 Click here to read the full report Nicole Wolkov, Christina Harward, Grace Mappes, Olivia Gibson, and Frederick W. Kagan with Nate Trotter May 22, 2025, 5:30 pm ET Note: The data cut-off for this product was 11:45 am ET on May 22. ISW will cover subsequent reports in the May 23 Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment. Russian President Vladimir Putin is fostering the formation of an informal state ideology based on Russian nationalism that positions Russia in opposition to the West as part of ongoing efforts to militarize and unify Russian society. Putin stated on May 22 at a likely highly scripted award ceremony that ""strong family foundations"" and ""traditional values"" support Russia's ""1,000-year-old statehood.""[1] Putin emphasized that Russia's ""most important"" task is to preserve its people, culture, and spirituality. A Russian Orthodox priest who received an award during the ceremony thanked Putin for protecting Russian traditional culture, spirituality, and language. The priest noted that Russia's celebrations of its contributions to victory in the Second World War teach Russian youth and those in the ""Russkiy Mir"" (""Russian World"") to defend Russia and love Russia's culture and spiritual foundations. (The ""Russian World"" is a Kremlin-promoted geopolitical concept with amorphous parameters that broadly encompass those who live outside of Russia's borders but relate in some vague way to Russian language, culture, Orthodoxy, and media). Russian State Historical Museum General Director and awardee Alexei Levikin claimed that many countries hostile to Russia are basing their policies and ideologies on the falsification of historical events and facts. A martial arts school director who received an award claimed that Russia always proves that its fighters are the best on the battlefields and in sports arenas. Putin notably promoted Russian nationalism by emphasizing Russia's spirituality and thousand-year history and by giving only a Russian Orthodox priest — but no representatives of other faiths — an award, despite the fact that the Russian state formally regards Russian Orthodoxy, Islam, Judaism, and Buddhism as Russia's ""traditional"" religions.[2] Putin has previously highlighted ethnic and religious minorities' contributions to Russia at high profile events and has often promoted a civic Russian identity and nationalism.[3] Putin's departure from this rhetoric at the highly staged event on May 22 may be an attempt to appease the increasingly pro-war Russian ultranationalist community. Putin is also attempting to use the awardees' statements to reinforce the creation of an informal state ideology predicated on perpetuating the belief that the West is determined to defeat Russia, thereby justifying a future military conflict against the West to the Russian public.[4] Putin declared 2025 the ""Year of the Defender of the Fatherland,"" and the development of an informal Russian nationalist ideology provides an ideological foundation for the ongoing Kremlin effort to develop a new cadre of loyal elites that includes selected veterans of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.[5] Putin will likely expand efforts to unify Russian society against the perceived threat of the West and to develop an elite class of militarized nationalists in order to ensure that any successor will embody similarly aggressive and dangerous ideals that perpetuate eternal conflict with the West and NATO. Russian Investigative Committee Head Alexander Bastrykin — one of the most outspoken Russian ultranationalists in Putin's inner circle — expressed support for the inclusion of an informal state ideology based on Russian nationalism in the Russian Constitution. Russian State Duma Deputy Speaker Pyotr Tolstoy stated on May 19 at the St. Petersburg International Legal Forum that Russia may change its constitution in the future.[6] Duma Committee on State Building and Legislation Head Pavel Krasheninnikov later stated at the forum that the Russian Constitution ""meets current realities"" and does not need amending, however.[7] Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated on May 19, in response to Tolstoy, that changing the constitution is ""not on the [Kremlin's] agenda.""[8] Bastrykin claimed in an interview with Kremlin newswire TASS published on May 22 that Russia is built on traditional values, such as patriotism, citizenship, service to the Fatherland, and a strong family, and that these traditional values should underpin Russia's ""national idea.""[9] Bastrykin further claimed that Russia should enshrine this ""national idea"" in its constitution. Bastrykin emphasized Russia's need to protect and preserve its ""historical heritage"" through legal frameworks. Bastrykin routinely publicly expresses interest in an informal Russian state ideology predicated on Russian ethno-religious nationalism and opposition to the West, in contrast to other senior Russian officials.[10] The Russian Constitution notably forbids the adoption of a formal state ideology.[11] Peskov stated on May 22 that it is difficult to comment on proposals to amend the Russian Constitution because the Kremlin does not have the specifics of such proposals — a departure from his May 19 statement apparently dismissing changes to the constitution.[12] Kremlin officials most recently leveraged Victory Day, Russia's largest holiday that commemorates the Soviet Union's contributions to the Second World War, to promote a new informal state ideology based on Russian unity in the face of opposition from the West.[13] The Kremlin is likely accelerating its promotion of this ideology to prepare the domestic population for a future military conflict against the West. Bastrykin is likely spearheading efforts to formally enshrine Russian nationalist ideology in the constitution as one of the most powerful and influential ultranationalists within the Kremlin elite. Russian authorities are renewing their years-long narrative rejecting the legality of the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, possibly to deny Ukrainian and Belarusian sovereignty and independence in the future. Russian State Duma Committee on the Protection of the Family, Fatherhood, Motherhood, and Childhood Head and member of the Communist Party Central Committee Nina Ostanina stated on May 22 that Duma deputies are ready to raise the issue of the alleged illegality of the dissolution of the Soviet Union.[14] Ostanina agreed with Russian Presidential Advisor Anton Kobyakov's May 21 claim that the Soviet Union's founding body was not involved in the dissolution of the Soviet Union and that, therefore, the Soviet Union still legally exists.[15] Ostanina further claimed that the dissolution of the Soviet Union was illegal because ""no one gave authority"" to then Belarusian Parliament Chairperson Stanislav Shushkevich, then Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic President Boris Yeltsin, and then Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk to sign the December 1991 Belovezha Accords, the internationally recognized document in which the Soviet republics of Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus agreed to dissolve the Soviet Union.[16] Russian authorities have intermittently revived false narratives about the illegality of the Soviet Union's dissolution and calls to reestablish the Soviet Union since at least 2014, and promoted this informational effort in 2021 and 2023.[17] The Kremlin has been pursuing its strategic effort to de facto annex Belarus through the framework of the Union State of Russia and Belarus and consistently denies Ukrainian sovereignty.[18] Russian officials, including Russian President Vladimir Putin and Investigative Committee Head Alexander Bastrykin, have frequently invoked the ""trinity doctrine"" — the ideological concept suggesting that Russians, Belarusians, and Ukrainians are a ""triune"" and forcibly separated people.[19] The Kremlin may be instructing lower-level officials to reinject the narrative about the allegedly illegal dissolution of the Soviet Union into the Russian information space in order to set conditions for the Kremlin to withdraw its recognition of Ukraine and Belarus as independent states in the future and call for a united Russian, Belarusian, and Ukrainian state. Russian officials have notably not acted upon past calls for the reestablishment of the Soviet Union, and the most recent iteration of this information campaign is similarly unlikely to have any near-term effects. Russian authorities and state media continue to publicly question the legitimacy of the Ukrainian negotiating team and the Ukrainian government, likely to further efforts to reject and delay negotiations and to set conditions to renege on any future peace agreement with Ukraine. Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) Legal Department Director Maksim Musikhin claimed to Kremlin newswire TASS on May 21 that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has ""long"" lost his ""internal"" and ""external"" legitimacy so there ""may be problems"" with any agreements Zelensky may sign in the future.[20] Musikhin claimed that a person ""who has the [Ukrainian] people's mandate"" should sign any future agreements and that the Ukrainian people must choose a new leader. Musikhin claimed that the Ukrainian Constitution may grant the head of the Ukrainian Verkhovna Rada the power to sign agreements. TASS also amplified a source allegedly ""close to the negotiations"" in Istanbul claiming that Ukraine will have to change the members of its negotiating group in order to work on a memorandum for a future peace treaty because the Ukrainian delegation at the recent Istanbul talks had a ""shortage of politicians.""[21] The source further questioned the legitimacy of any future Ukrainian negotiating group by claiming that the group may include ""spies"" working for European states or the United States. Musikhin is reiterating the longstanding false Kremlin claim that Zelensky is not the legitimate leader of Ukraine and therefore cannot sign any agreements with Russia.[22] Musikhin is also repeating Russian President Vladimir Putin's false claim that the Verkhovna Rada is the only legitimate power in Ukraine.[23] Kremlin officials have repeatedly claimed that Ukraine must hold elections for its government to be legitimate even though Ukraine's constitution and law explicitly prohibits elections during periods of martial law and prohibits the Ukrainian government from lifting martial law during invasion by a hostile country.[24] Musikhin's statements and these Russian state media reports are part of the Kremlin's ongoing efforts to set conditions for Russia to justify its withdrawal from any future peace agreements with Ukraine at a time of Russia's choosing and to support Russia's repeated demand that Ukraine acquiesce to regime change and the installation of a pro-Russian government.[25]

Recent Western reporting provided additional details in a case in which Russian forces executed Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) in November 2024, supporting ISW's assessment that high-level Russian military commanders are likely involved in these executions. CNN reported on May 21 that a Ukrainian intelligence official provided drone footage and intercepted audio in which a Russian commander ordered the execution of Ukrainian POWs and that the footage and audio correspond to a credible report of a Russian execution in western Zaporizhia Oblast in November 2024.[26] CNN reported that it could not independently verify the radio intercept or its link to the execution but noted that a forensic expert and an unnamed Western intelligence official found the audio to be authentic and ""consistent with previously documented brutal executions."" Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) told CNN that elements of a ""Storm"" unit of the Russian 394th Motorized Rifle Regiment (127th Motorized Rifle Division, 5th Combined Arms Army [CAA], Eastern Military District [EMD]) were responsible for the November 2024 executions and at least one other suspected execution. ISW observed additional reporting and footage that indicated that Russian forces captured and disarmed six Ukrainian POWs and executed five at close range near Novodarivka (eastern Zaporizhia Oblast) on November 23, 2024, in violation of international law.[27] UN Special Rapporteur on extra-judicial summary or arbitrary executions Morris Tidball-Binz told CNN that Russian executions of Ukrainian POWs cannot occur at such high numbers or frequency without the orders or consent of the highest Russian military commanders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin. There has been a sharp increase in credible reports and footage of Russian forces executing Ukrainian POWs throughout 2024 and 2025, and ISW continues to assess that Russian military commanders are either complicit in or directly enabling their subordinates to conduct systemic executions in direct violation of international law.[28]

Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov confirmed on May 22 Colonel General Andrei Mordvichev's appointment as Russian Ground Forces Commander.[29] ISW continues to assess that the Kremlin likely appointed Mordvichev to proliferate positional warfare tactics and operational concepts for grinding marginal advances — the main tactics Russian forces used in the Avdiivka-Pokrovsk direction — across Russia’s Ground Forces.[30]

Key Takeaways: Russian President Vladimir Putin is fostering the formation of an informal state ideology based on Russian nationalism that positions Russia in opposition to the West as part of ongoing efforts to militarize and unify Russian society.

Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment May 21, 2025 Click here to read the full report Christina Harward, Grace Mappes, Olivia Gibson, Anna Harvey, Daria Novikov, and Karolina Hird with Nate Trotter and William Runkel Note: The data cut-off for this product was 12:45 pm ET on May 21. ISW will cover subsequent reports in the May 22 Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment. Russian President Vladimir Putin likely orchestrated a meeting with Kursk Oblast officials on May 20 to set conditions to justify the renewal of Russian plans to seize Sumy City and illegally annex Sumy Oblast. Putin met with municipal leaders in Kursk Oblast on May 20, during which the head of Glushkovsky Raion, Pavel Zolotarev, asked Putin to create a buffer zone in Sumy Oblast.[1] Putin asked how many kilometers deep this buffer zone should be, and Zolotarev claimed that Russia should seize ""at least Sumy (City)"" and implied that Russia should be ""bigger.""[2] Acting Kursk Oblast Governor Alexander Khinshtein later responded to the interaction on his Telegram channel, claiming that his grandfather was from Sumy Oblast, so ""this land is not foreign to [him].""[3] Sumy City is roughly 25 kilometers from the international border, and a buffer zone deep enough to include Sumy City would prevent Ukrainian forces from conducting tube artillery and tactical drone strikes against Russian territory. Western and Ukrainian sources reported that the Russian delegation at the May 16 Ukrainian-Russian talks in Istanbul threatened to seize Sumy Oblast in order to create a ""security zone.""[4] ISW continues to assess that Russia has territorial aims beyond the oblasts that Russia has already illegally occupied or annexed and that Putin may intend to leverage further advances in Sumy Oblast to demand that Ukraine cede part of Sumy Oblast to Russia during future peace negotiations.[5] The Kremlin likely arranged the interaction at the May 20 meeting in order to frame Putin as an effective and engaged wartime leader by responding to Russian requests to further advance in Sumy Oblast and suggesting that Russia lay claim to more territory within Ukraine. Putin's visit to Kursk Oblast on May 20 for the first time since Russia claimed military victory in the oblast on April 26.[6] ISW has observed reports that Ukrainian forces maintain limited positions in Kursk Oblast as fighting continues, despite official Kremlin claims that Russian forces pushed Ukrainian forces out of the oblast entirely.[7] The Ukrainian General Staff reported on May 21 that Ukrainian forces continue active combat operations in Kursk Oblast.[8] Putin also met with Acting Kursk Oblast Governor Alexander Khinshtein and agreed to continue providing federal funding for local residents and to increase demining operations.[9] Putin's meeting with Khinshtein is part of the Kremlin's ongoing efforts to portray Putin as an effective and caring wartime leader and to downplay Russian failures in the Ukraine theater.[10] Russian forces are highly unlikely to be able to seize Sumy City in the near- to medium-term given Russia's demonstrated inability to rapidly seize even much smaller settlements in Ukraine in the past three years. Ukrainian military observer Kostyantyn Mashovets reported on May 19 that elements of the Russian 18th Motorized Rifle Division (11th Army Corps [AC], Leningrad Military District [LMD]) and 72nd Motorized Rifle Division (44th AC, LMD) are conducting most of the assaults in the Sumy direction and that elements of the 83rd Separate Airborne (VDV) Brigade are likely also operating in the Sumy direction.[11] Mashovets stated that up to four or five motorized rifle and rifle regiments of the Russian mobilization reserve are also operating in the Sumy direction.[12] These limited elements reportedly operating in the Sumy direction are insufficient to seize a city as large as Sumy City (pre-war population of 256,000), and Russian forces have not demonstrated the capability to seize large cities since the first months of the war. Russian forces have not seized a Ukrainian city with a pre-war population greater than 100,000 since capturing Lysychansk, Luhansk Oblast in July 2022, but the seizure of Lysychansk was the result of a slow grinding effort that caused Russian offensive operations in eastern Ukraine to culminate in summer 2022, as opposed to a rapid and effective maneuver operation.[13] Russian forces have since struggled to seize much smaller settlements in subsequent campaigns despite using larger numbers of forces, especially in eastern and northern Ukraine.[14] Ukrainian officials have also previously expressed doubt that Russian forces would be able to conduct an effective offensive operation to seize Sumy City.[15] Russia continues to promote the false narrative accusing Ukrainian forces of ""neo-Nazism"" as part of dual Kremlin efforts to justify continued Russian offensive operations in Ukraine despite ongoing peace talks, and to prepare the Russian population for a Russian rejection of any future peace agreement. Putin also used the visit to Kursk Oblast to claim that Ukrainian forces intentionally damaged monuments to the Second World War during the Kursk Oblast incursion.[16] Putin claimed that Ukrainian forces' alleged destruction of these monuments ""gives [Russia] every reason to say that these are people with neo-Nazi ideology."" The Kremlin has long promoted the narrative that Ukraine harbors neo-Nazi ideology in an effort to justify its military aggression against Ukraine and its calls for regime change in Kyiv. Kremlin officials, including Putin, have recently claimed that the Ukrainian government does not fully control the Ukrainian military and lacks control over alleged ""neo-Nazi groups"" as part of wider Kremlin efforts to undermine the Ukrainian government's legitimacy and present Ukraine as an illegitimate negotiating partner.[17] ISW continues to assess that the Kremlin is using its narratives about the Ukrainian government's illegitimacy to set conditions to renege on any future Ukrainian-Russian agreements, and the Kremlin may intensify this informational campaign to socialize the Russian domestic audience for such a future rejection.[18] The fact that Putin is perpetuating these narratives to justify further offensive operations in Ukraine highlights the dissonance between Putin's posturing to Western audiences versus his posturing to a domestic audience. Russia continues to reject American proposals to establish a ceasefire in Ukraine before starting negotiations to end the war. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated on May 20 that the United States is waiting for Russia to present a document outlining the ""terms that [Russia] would require in order to reach a ceasefire that would then allow for broader negotiations.""[19] Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov directly rejected on May 21 the idea that Russia and Ukraine should come to ""a truce and then we'll see,"" apparently disparaging the United States and its partners' attempts to facilitate negotiations.[20] Lavrov claimed that Russia does not want to repeat the Istanbul 2022 Ukrainian-Russian talks. Lavrov's May 21 statement is an explicit rejection of the US proposal for the establishment of a ceasefire first and then peace talks.[21] ISW has long assessed that Russia attempted to use the Istanbul 2022 talks to frame Russia's demands for Ukraine's full surrender as legitimate and reasonable.[22] Lavrov's statements indicate that Russia continues to conflate the ceasefire and peace settlement processes, as Russia remains committed to making incremental gains on the battlefield indefinitely. Russian officials are setting conditions to refuse Western involvement in peace negotiations to end Russia's war in Ukraine and for Russia to deny the independence and sovereignty of other former Soviet states. Russian Presidential Advisor Anton Kobyakov claimed on May 21 that the Soviet Union's founding body, the Congress of People's Deputies, was not involved in dissolving the Soviet Union, so the Soviet Union still legally exists and the war in Ukraine is therefore an ""internal process.""[23] Kobyakov further claimed that the Supreme Soviets of the Union Republics did not have the legal authority to ratify the December 1991 Belovezha Accords, the internationally recognized document in which the Soviet republics of Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus agreed to dissolve the Soviet Union.[24] The parliament of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic elected Boris Yeltsin president of the Russian republic in 1990, and it is in this capacity that he legally signed the Belovezha Accords.[25] Article 72 of the 1977 Constitution of the Soviet Union, however, notably already gave each republic the right to freely secede from the USSR.[26] The Soviet republics formalized the dissolution of the Soviet Union with Declaration No. 142-N in December 1991.[27] Russia has long recognized the independence of and established diplomatic relations with the former Soviet republics.[28] Russia has since entered into a number of treaties with Ukraine, explicitly acknowledging Ukraine's legitimacy.[29] Russia has also long claimed the right to protect its ""compatriots abroad"" in former Soviet states and created simplified pathways for citizens of former Soviet states to obtain Russian passports – implicit acknowledgments of these states' independence from Russia.[30] Kobyakov's claims are likely part of efforts to set conditions for the Kremlin to present its full-scale invasion of Ukraine as an ""internal Russian affair"" in which foreign states should not be involved, including during peace negotiations to end the war. Kobyakov's statements notably also further set conditions for Russia to deny the legitimacy of all the former Soviet republics and to claim the right to violate the territorial integrity of other former Soviet countries beyond Ukraine. The Kremlin has long claimed that Russia is the legitimate successor state to both the Soviet Union and the Russian Empire, and ISW continues to assess that Russia seeks to reconstitute the Soviet Union and the Russian Empire.[31] Russian security services continue to conduct hybrid operations against the United States and its allies in preparation for a larger future war with NATO. The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), along with the intelligence services of Germany, Czechia, Poland, Australia, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, France, and the Netherlands, issued a cybersecurity advisory on May 21 warning that a Russian state-sponsored cyber campaign has been targeting Western logistics and technology companies for over two years.[32] The report stated that the 85th Main Special Service Center (Unit 26165) of the Russian General Staff's Main Directorate (GRU) has targeted the defense, transportation, and IT service verticals of both government and commercial entities within NATO member states, Romania, Moldova, and Ukraine. Unit 26165 actors reportedly exploited systemic vulnerabilities and leveraged spearfishing, brute guessing, and impersonation campaigns to access information on Western aid shipments to Ukraine, including vessel numbers, routes, and cargo contents. The actors also likely gained remote access to private cameras near key logistics hubs and through public sources, such as traffic cameras, to track the movement of materials into Ukraine. IP camera attacks are largely targeted at cameras within Ukraine, Romania, Poland, Hungary, and Slovakia. The recent establishment of the first formal motorcycle unit within the Ukrainian military demonstrates the rapid technical adaptation cycle that has become typical in Ukraine and that will become a key characteristic of future wars. Ukraine’s 425th “Skala” Separate Assault Regiment reported on May 20 that the Ukrainian military command formed Ukraine’s first assault motorcycle company within the regiment and tasked the company with conducting adaptable assault operations and quickly breaking through Russian positions.[33] Ukraine is likely developing its own motorcycle units in response to the recent Russian formalization of its use of motorcycles — a tactic Russian forces have increasingly used on the battlefield since late 2024.[34] Russian forces have grown increasingly reliant on light vehicles such as motorcycles, buggies, and all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) due to successful Ukrainian drone strikes that have damaged and destroyed Russian armored vehicles and exacerbated Russia's vehicle shortages.[35] Russian forces appear to be undergoing a transition period and moving towards regularly conducting assaults exclusively on motorcycles.[36] Ukraine’s formation of its motorcycle unit demonstrates the rapid proliferation of technical adaptations throughout the frontline in Ukraine, with major changes implemented across a thousand-kilometer frontline in as few as two to three weeks.[37] Key Takeaways: Russian President Vladimir Putin likely orchestrated a meeting with Kursk Oblast officials on May 20 to set conditions to justify the renewal of Russian plans to seize Sumy City and illegally annex Sumy Oblast.

Russian forces are highly unlikely to be able to seize Sumy City in the near- to medium-term given Russia's demonstrated inability to rapidly seize even much smaller settlements in Ukraine in the past three years.

Russia continues to promote the false narrative accusing Ukrainian forces of ""neo-Nazism"" as part of dual Kremlin efforts to justify continued Russian offensive operations in Ukraine despite ongoing peace talks, and to prepare the Russian population for a Russian rejection of any future peace agreement.

Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment May 20, 2025 Click here to read the full report Daria Novikov, Nicole Wolkov, Anna Harvey, Angelica Evans, and Karolina Hird with William Runkel Senior Russian officials continue to deny the legitimacy of the Ukrainian president, government, and constitution and Ukraine's sovereignty despite Russian President Vladimir Putin's recent efforts to feign interest in peace negotiations to end the war. Russian Security Council Secretary Dmitry Medvedev claimed during the St. Petersburg International Legal Forum on May 20 that there are currently no Ukrainian officials with the authority to conclude a peace treaty with Russia and that Russia may need to consult Ukraine’s Constitution to identify authorized negotiation partners.[1] Medvedev questioned Ukraine's sovereignty and claimed that Ukraine is a ""failed state"" whose leaders’ lack of legitimacy raises ""serious questions"" about who Russia can negotiate with during future peace negotiations.[2] Medvedev‘s claims directly contradict Putin’s reported agreement with US President Donald Trump to immediately begin bilateral negotiations with Ukraine.[3] Medvedev’s statements indicate that Russia is, in fact, not interested in engaging with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and other senior Ukrainian government officials who are key to bilateral negotiations to end the war. Russian officials have repeatedly promoted the false narrative that Zelensky and the Ukrainian government are illegitimate to justify Russia’s refusal to engage in good-faith negotiations with Ukraine and further Russia's long-standing war goal of establishing a pro-Russian puppet government in Kyiv.[4] Ukraine's Constitution and Ukrainian law explicitly state that Ukraine cannot hold elections while martial law is in place and that Ukrainian authorities cannot lift martial law while ""the threat of attack or danger to the state independence of Ukraine and its territorial integrity"" remains.[5] Zelensky also recently clarified that a September 2022 presidential decree does not preclude him from negotiating with Putin.[6] Chairperson of Ukraine’s Verkhovna Rada Foreign Affairs Committee Oleksandr Merezhko recently stated that Ukraine’s Constitution ""clearly"" specifies Zelensky as Ukraine’s chief negotiator and noted that Zelensky’s constitutional powers allow him to override past decrees.[7] ISW continues to assess that any long-term peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine must include Russia’s explicit recognition of the legitimacy of the Ukrainian president, government, and the Ukrainian Constitution.[8] Medvedev also reiterated long-standing Russian demands tantamount to Ukraine’s complete capitulation. Medvedev falsely claimed that Russia’s illegal annexation of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhia, and Kherson oblasts and Crimea was legitimate under international law, underscoring Russia's unwillingness to make any concessions in peace negotiations to end the war in Ukraine.[9] Medvedev also demanded that Ukraine demilitarize the current frontline, refuse foreign military aid, and reject European peacekeeping deployments to Ukraine.[10] Medvedev stated that Russia would consider the deployment of European forces to be a military threat and categorize future deployments of European forces in Ukraine as legitimate military targets.[11] Medvedev’s statements indicate that Russia has not abandoned its original goals in Ukraine, which include the ""demilitarization"" and ""denazification"" of Ukraine, securing international recognition of large parts of southern and eastern Ukraine as Russian territory, and a permanent non-aligned status for Ukraine.[12] Medvedev's threats against future European peacekeepers are also part of an ongoing effort to frame the current war in Ukraine as an existential conflict between Russia and the West.[13] Medvedev’s statements indicate that Putin has not ordered Russian officials to abandon ongoing narrative efforts to discredit Ukraine in response to promises that Putin allegedly made to Trump and that Putin likely does not intend to engage in good-faith negotiations with Ukraine. Ukraine's Western allies continue to provide military aid to Ukraine and support Ukraine's defense industry. Italian media reported in mid-May 2025 that Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto announced that Italy approved an eleventh military aid package for Ukraine, which will include one SAMP/T air and missile defense system, 400 M-113 armored personnel carriers, and ammunition.[14] Ukrainian state-owned defense enterprise manager Ukroboronprom reported on May 20 that it signed a memorandum of cooperation with Belgian ammunition manufacturer KNDS Belgium to coordinate the joint assembly of medium-caliber ammunition for automatic cannons.[15] The European Union (EU) and the United Kingdom (UK) announced several sanctions packages against Russia on May 20.[16] The package is the EU's largest targeting Russia's shadow fleet and the Russian energy and military-industrial sector.[17] The EU also sanctioned the Russian Radiological, Chemical, and Biological Defense Troops; the 27th Scientific Center; and the Russian Ministry of Defense's 33rd Central Scientific Research and Testing Institute for Russia's use of chemical weapons in Ukraine.[18] The UK also announced new sanctions against Russia's military, energy, and financial sectors on May 20.[19] The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) confirmed Colonel General Valery Solodchuk's recent appointment as Central Military District (CMD) commander on May 20.[20] Solodchuk most recently served as commander of the Kursk Grouping of Forces and led Russia's efforts to eliminate the Ukrainian salient in Kursk Oblast.[21] Solodchuk is replacing Colonel General Andrei Mordvichev, who reportedly recently replaced General Oleg Salyukov as Russian Ground Forces Commander.[22] Key Takeaways: Senior Russian officials continue to deny the legitimacy of the Ukrainian president, government, and constitution and Ukraine's sovereignty despite Russian President Vladimir Putin's recent efforts to feign interest in peace negotiations to end the war.

Medvedev also reiterated long-standing Russian demands tantamount to Ukraine’s complete capitulation.

Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment May 19, 2025 Click here to read the full report Christina Harward, Daria Novikov, Anna Harvey, Nicole Wolkov, Grace Mappes, and Kateryna Stepanenko May 19, 2025, 5:30 pm ET Note: The data cut-off for this product was 11:15 am ET on May 19. ISW will cover subsequent reports in the May 20 Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment. US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin held a phone call on May 19 to discuss ceasefire and peace negotiations regarding Russia's war in Ukraine. Trump stated that he and Putin agreed that Russia and Ukraine will immediately begin bilateral negotiations about both a ceasefire and a peace agreement.[1] Trump also said that he called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Finnish President Alexander Stubb, and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen after his conversation with Putin and informed them that bilateral negotiations will begin immediately. Trump stated that the Vatican is ""very interested in hosting the negotiations."" Trump also expressed interest in reviving US–Russian trade after Ukraine and Russia agree to a peace deal and said that Ukraine could also benefit from trade during the reconstruction process. Putin spoke to journalists following the call on May 19 and stated that he and Trump agreed that Russia would present Ukraine with a ""memorandum"" detailing conditions and timing for a future peace treaty as the two countries move toward conducting bilateral negotiations.[2] Putin also stated that Russia’s ""main"" concern is the elimination of the war’s ""root causes,"" reiterating a long-standing Kremlin narrative calling for the replacement of the current Ukrainian government with a Russian proxy government and Ukraine's commitment to neutrality.[3] Russian Presidential Aide Yuriy Ushakov told journalists on May 19 that Trump and Putin also discussed a possible nine-for-nine US–Russian prisoner exchange.[4]

Zelensky stated that he spoke with Trump before Trump's call with Putin and spoke with Trump, Macron, Meloni, Merz, Stubb, and von der Leyen following the Trump–Putin call.[5] Zelensky reaffirmed Ukraine's readiness for a full unconditional ceasefire as Trump has previously proposed. Zelensky stated that Ukraine is ready for direct negotiations with Russia ""in any format"" and offered Turkey, the Vatican, or Switzerland as possible venues for talks. Zelensky called for the negotiation process to involve both American and European representatives ""at the appropriate level."" Russia must break its pattern of protracting negotiations and failing to offer any meaningful concessions to Ukraine in order for legitimate and good-faith negotiations to lead to a lasting and sustainable end to its war against Ukraine. Russia must explicitly acknowledge the legitimacy of the Ukrainian president, government, and constitution and Ukraine's sovereignty in order to engage in meaningful, good-faith negotiations. Putin and other Kremlin officials have repeatedly falsely claimed that Zelensky is the illegitimate leader according to the Ukrainian Constitution and that all Ukrainian governments since 2014 are also illegitimate.[6] Ukraine's Constitution and law explicitly state that Ukraine cannot hold elections while martial law is in place and that Ukrainian authorities cannot lift martial law while ""the threat of attack or danger to the state independence of Ukraine and its territorial integrity"" remains.[7] Russia and Ukraine cannot engage in meaningful negotiations so long as Russia refuses to recognize the negotiating authority of Ukraine. Russian officials have forwarded the narrative about the Ukrainian government's alleged illegitimacy as recently as May 17, and ISW continues to assess that this Russian effort is aimed at setting conditions for Russia to renege on any future Ukrainian–Russian agreements at a time of Russia's choosing.[8] Any future peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine must include Russia's explicit recognition of the legitimacy of the Ukrainian president, government, and constitution. Russia must agree that ceasefire negotiations must precede peace settlement negotiations. The United States, Ukraine, and Europe have repeatedly called for the establishment of a ceasefire to allow for diplomatic talks to end Russia's war in Ukraine to proceed.[9] Russia has consistently rejected this sequence of events as part of efforts to hold any ceasefire talks hostage to extract additional concessions from Ukraine and the West.[10] ISW continues to assess that Russia is committed to prolonging peace negotiations so as to continue making battlefield advances.[11] Peace talks ahead of an established ceasefire would allow Russia to continue to make advances in Ukraine, which Russia would likely try to leverage in Ukrainian–Russian talks to extract further concessions. Any future ceasefire will require Russia and Ukraine to engage in separate negotiations to agree on the necessary robust monitoring mechanisms, and conflating ceasefire talks with peace settlement talks will likely delay the implementation of a ceasefire. Russia must show its willingness to make concessions of its own in any future bilateral negotiations, especially as the Kremlin appears to be setting conditions to expand its list of demands amid the peace talks.[12] Russian officials have called for Ukraine to cede all of Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhia, and Kherson oblasts — even the areas that Russian forces do not currently occupy — before Russia can agree to a ceasefire.[13] Territorial demands are typically the subject of war termination negotiations, not ceasefire talks. Russia has reportedly already started to increase its demands, with Western and Ukrainian sources reporting that the Russian delegation threatened to seize Kharkiv and Sumy oblasts — two oblasts that Russia has not illegally annexed or claimed — during the May 16 talks in Istanbul.[14] This tactic suggests that Russia will make additional, more extreme territorial demands during war termination talks should Ukraine agree to Russia's ceasefire preconditions. Russia reportedly continues to expand its military infrastructure along its border with Finland and Estonia, likely in preparation for future aggression against NATO. The New York Times (NYT) reported on May 19 that recent satellite imagery, which NATO officials confirmed, shows that Russia is building bases and military infrastructure near the Finnish and Estonian borders.[15] The NYT reported that Russian forces are building and renovating tents, vehicle storage warehouses, fighter jet shelters, and helicopter bases at Olenya and Alakurtti air bases in Murmansk Oblast, Kamenka Air Base in Komi Republic, and Petrozavodsk Air Base in the Republic of Karelia. A senior NATO official stated that Russia will likely redeploy troops further north when its war in Ukraine ends and that Russia assesses that its access to the Arctic is key for its great power status. The NYT stated that Finnish defense officials predict that it will take Russia roughly five years to build up its forces to threatening levels after the war in Ukraine is over, possibly tripling the number of Russian forces on the Finnish border. The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) similarly reported in April 2025 that Western military and intelligence officials stated that Russia is expanding military bases near Petrozavodsk and upgrading railway lines and other infrastructure along Russia's western border with NATO.[16] Russian Presidential Aide and former Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev recently used narratives similar to those that the Kremlin has used to justify its invasions of Ukraine to threaten Finland.[17]

Ukraine's Western allies continue to provide military aid to Ukraine. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on May 18 and confirmed the provision of Abrams tanks to Ukraine, and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) reported on May 19 that the first of 49 Abrams tanks are en route to Ukraine.[18] Denmark announced on May 17 a military aid package for Ukraine worth 4.2 billion Danish kroner (about $632 million) for 2025–2028 that includes artillery systems and ammunition, equipment for fighter jets, and funding for Ukrainian Air Force training facilities.[19] The Finnish Ministry of Defense (MoD) announced on May 19 that it signed an agreement with the European Commission to supply Ukraine with materiel and heavy ammunition worth 90 million euros (about $101 million) using the profits from Russian frozen assets.[20]

Key Takeaways: US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin held a phone call on May 19 to discuss ceasefire and peace negotiations regarding Russia's war in Ukraine.

Russia must explicitly acknowledge the legitimacy of the Ukrainian president, government, and constitution and Ukraine's sovereignty in order to engage in meaningful, good-faith negotiations.

Russia must agree that ceasefire negotiations must precede peace settlement negotiations.

Russia must show its willingness to make concessions of its own in any future bilateral negotiations, especially as the Kremlin appears to be setting conditions to expand its list of demands amid the peace talks.

Russian forces conducted the largest single drone strike of the war against Ukraine on the night of May 17 to 18 – in disregard of US President Donald Trump's calls for Russia to stop long-range strikes against Ukraine, particularly against Kyiv Oblast.[1] The Ukrainian Air Force reported that Russian forces launched 273 Shahed and decoy drones from the directions of Bryansk, Kursk, and Oryol cities; Millerovo, Rostov Oblast; and Primorsko-Akhtarsk, Krasnodar Krai.[2] The Ukrainian Air Force reported that Ukrainian forces shot down 88 drones over eastern, northern, and central Ukraine; that 128 decoy drones were ""lost in location;"" and that one drone was still in Ukrainian airspace as of 0800 local time. Ukrainian officials reported that the Russian strike largely targeted Kyiv Oblast and that drones struck Kyiv, Dnipropetrovsk, and Donetsk oblasts.[3] Russian forces launched 267 drones (and three ballistic missiles) in their overnight strike series against Ukraine on the night of February 22 and 23.[4] Russian forces have significantly intensified their nightly strikes against Ukraine over the last five months and have conducted several of the largest strikes of the entire war since January 2025. A Russian milblogger claimed that the May 17-18 record-breaking strike was effective due to Russia's use of the ""Geran-3"" drone (the Russian analogue to the Iranian Shahed-238), which is reportedly equipped with a turbo jet and 300-kilogram warhead.[5] ISW continues to assess that Russian forces are innovating their long-range drone strike tactics in order to offset the effectiveness of Ukrainian mobile defense units and overwhelm the Ukrainian air defense umbrella.[6] The Kremlin continues efforts to project Russia's military strength ahead of US President Donald Trump’s scheduled phone call with Putin on May 19. Kremlin journalist Pavel Zarubin published on May 18 excerpts of an allegedly ""new"" interview with Putin, in which Putin claimed that Russia has enough manpower and materiel to bring the war in Ukraine to its ""logical"" conclusion with the ""necessary"" results for Russia.[7] Putin reiterated long-standing Kremlin narratives about the necessity that peace negotiations address the war’s ""root causes"" and ""protect"" of Russian-speakers of Ukraine, whom Putin claimed consider Russia their ""motherland."" Ukrainian outlet The Kyiv Independent and Russian state media reported on May 18 that the excerpts that Zarubin published on May 18 are unaired footage from the documentary ""Russia.Kremlin.Putin.25 Years"" that the Kremlin published on May 4 in which Putin repeatedly promoted claims about Russia’s ability to bring the war to its ""logical conclusion.""[8] The Kremlin's decision to delay publishing these clips until May 18 suggests that the Kremlin is trying to project a strong, militarily superior Russia to the West and to domestic Russian audiences ahead of Putin’s May 19 phone call with Trump. Russian Presidential Aide Vladimir Medinsky recently stated that Russia is prepared to fight for ""however long it takes,"" and Russian Security Council Secretary Dmitry Medvedev recently made thinly veiled nuclear threats in reference to what Medvedev categorized as ""negotiating ultimatums.""[9] Putin is attempting to distract from Russia's military and economic challenges with this rhetoric. Finnish President Alexander Stubb stated during an interview with UK outlet the Guardian published on May 18 that the Kremlin is falsely posturing its economy and military as strong.[10] Stubb noted that Russia has depleted its financial reserves and that the Russian interest rate is over 20 percent. ISW continues to assess that Russian forces are sustaining significant battlefield losses at rates that are likely unsustainable in the medium- to long-term and that Putin has mismanaged Russia's economy, which is suffering from unsustainable war spending, growing inflation, significant labor shortages, and reductions in Russia's sovereign wealth fund.[11] The continued depletion of Russian materiel, personnel, and economic resources at the current rate will likely present Putin with difficult decision points in 2026 or 2027.[12] Reported support within the Russian military and society for continuing the war until Russia achieves its original war aims and territorial demands reflects the success of the Kremlin's years-long narrative efforts to justify a protracted war effort. The New York Times (NYT) reported on May 17 that interviews with 11 Russian soldiers who are currently fighting or have fought in Ukraine demonstrate that some Russian troops are against an unconditional ceasefire and believe that Russia should keep fighting until Russian forces have seized the entirety of Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhia, and Kherson oblasts.[13] Russian soldiers reportedly called for Russia to continue the war until it reaches its territorial goals and not offer any concessions to Ukraine or the West so that Russia does not have to fight Ukraine again in five or 10 years and so that Russian casualties thus far in the war will not have been in vain. The NYT noted that an unpublished mid-April 2025 poll by independent Russian opposition polling organization Chronicles found that roughly half of respondents said that they would not support a peace deal that falls short of Russian President Vladimir Putin's initial war aims of Ukrainian ""denazification,"" demilitarization, and neutrality. Russian opposition outlet Verstka conducted a poll of 100 Russian military personnel in April 2025 in which only 18 percent said they would support a Russian withdrawal from Ukraine prior to achieving Putin's stated war goals and only about a fifth of respondents indicated that they thought the war would end in the coming months.[14] ISW continues to assess that the Kremlin has not been preparing the Russian information space for a peace agreement in the near future and that Russian forces and society do not anticipate an imminent end to the war.[15] The Kremlin has been engaged in a concerted effort to justify Putin's war aims as existential to the Russian state and to garner societal support for the protraction of the war until Russia achieves these goals. Kremlin officials are increasingly publicly stating that Russia is prepared to continue fighting until Ukraine accepts Russia's demands, likely because the Kremlin assesses that it has adequately prepared Russian society and the Russian military for such a scenario.[16] Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky continues efforts to negotiate a diplomatic end to the war in Ukraine. Zelensky spoke with US Vice President JD Vance and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Rome on May 18 and highlighted the importance of an unconditional ceasefire in Ukraine and Ukraine's willingness to engage in meaningful diplomacy.[17] Zelensky underscored that the Russian delegation presented unrealistic and unacceptable terms during the May 16 Ukrainian–Russian talks in Istanbul. Rubio had a call on May 17 with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, during which Rubio reiterated the Trump administration's call for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine.[18] Ukraine continues to demonstrate its willingness to establish meaningful peace dialogues and commit to an unconditional ceasefire.[19] Russia, however, continues to demonstrate that it is not interested in a ceasefire or in good faith negotiations to end the war.[20] Key Takeaways: Russian forces conducted the largest single drone strike of the war against Ukraine on the night of May 17 to 18 — in disregard of US President Donald Trump's calls for Russia to stop long-range strikes against Ukraine, particularly against Kyiv Oblast.

The Kremlin continues efforts to project Russia's military strength ahead of US President Donald Trump’s scheduled phone call with Putin on May 19.

Reported support within the Russian military and society for continuing the war until Russia achieves its original war aims and territorial demands reflects the success of the Kremlin's years-long narrative efforts to justify a protracted war effort.

Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, May 17, 2025 Click here to read the full report. Anna Harvey, Olivia Gibson, Christina Harward, and Frederick W. Kagan with Nate Trotter May 17, 2025, 6:40 pm ET Note: The data cut-off for this product was 12:15pm ET on May 17. ISW will cover subsequent reports in the May 18 Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment. The Russian delegation in Istanbul reportedly framed its demands for a final peace settlement as preconditions that Ukraine must meet before Russia will agree to a ceasefire. Most of Russia's demands are contrary to US President Donald Trump's proposed peace plan. Sources familiar with the May 16 Ukrainian–Russian talks in Istanbul reported to Bloomberg that the Russian delegation demanded that Ukraine cede all of Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhia, and Kherson oblasts and Crimea to Russia and that the international community recognize the four oblasts and the peninsula as Russian territory before Russia will agree to a ceasefire.[1] The Russian delegation also reportedly demanded that Ukraine adopt a neutral status, that no foreign troops be allowed on Ukrainian territory, and that Ukraine abandon its demands for war reparations from Russia. Chairperson of the Russian Federation Council's Committee on Foreign Affairs Grigory Karasin stated on May 17 that the Russian delegation maintained Russian President Vladimir Putin's June 2024 demands, including that Ukrainian forces withdraw from the entirety of the four oblasts and abandon its NATO aspirations before Russia would agree to a ceasefire and peace negotiations.[2] The United States reportedly presented Russia in April 2025 with a seven-point peace plan that offered Russia ""de jure"" US recognition of Russian sovereignty over occupied Crimea and ""de facto"" recognition of Russian control over the parts of Ukraine that Russian forces currently occupy.[3] The US proposal also reportedly included ""a robust security guarantee"" involving a group of European states and possibly non-European states as a likely peacekeeping force. The Russian delegation's demands in Istanbul outright reject these aspects of the US peace proposal. ISW continues to assess that Russia's war aim remains full Ukrainian capitulation.[4] Russia is reframing its territorial demands — typically the subject of war termination negotiations — as preconditions for a ceasefire.[5] Russia is attempting to posture itself as open to negotiations but is putting forward demands that Ukraine cannot reasonably accept while offering no compromises of its own. ISW continues to assess that Putin will continue to refuse to offer compromises until Ukraine and the West are able to alter his theory of victory, which posits that Russia will win a war of attrition through indefinite creeping advances that prevent Ukraine from conducting successful, operationally significant counteroffensive operations.[6] Russia's continued protraction of negotiations emphasizes its unwillingness to engage in good-faith negotiations for either a ceasefire or a final peace agreement. Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated on May 17 that Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky may meet only if the Russian and Ukrainian delegations reach unspecified agreements and underscored that all talks should be conducted behind closed doors.[7] Peskov's statements are likely intentionally vague in order to further delay progress in Russian-Ukrainian talks. Russian opposition outlet Verstka reported on May 17 that a source close to the Russian Presidential Administration stated the Kremlin viewed discussions between Putin and Zelensky as ""out of the question"" as Moscow knew that the conditions it was pushing Ukraine to accept were non-starters for Kyiv.[8] Another Verstka source close to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) similarly stated that Russian officials do not plan to discuss preparations for a Putin-Zelensky meeting. Russia has doubled down on its efforts to protract peace processes by continuing to present Ukraine with ultimatums that Ukraine cannot accept. The Verstka source close to the Presidential Administration added that Russia's demand that the Ukrainian–Russian talks occur without a mediator shows that the Kremlin seeks to demonstrate that it is capable of demanding that the United States limit the influence of Ukraine's Western partners. Peskov's comments and Verstka's report cohere with ISW's long-standing assessment that Russia remains committed to prolonging peace negotiations so as to continue making battlefield advances and to extract additional concessions from the West.[9] Ukraine has continually demonstrated its willingness to compromise and engage in good-faith negotiations in contrast. Kremlin officials continue to signal that Russia is prepared to continue or even escalate its war against Ukraine should Ukraine and the West not agree to Russia's demands for Ukraine's surrender. Russian Security Council Deputy Chairperson Dmitry Medvedev claimed on May 17 on his English-language X account that ""all enemies of Russia that issue negotiating ultimatums"" should remember that peace negotiations do not always lead to the end of hostilities and that unsuccessful negotiations can even lead to a ""more terrible stage of war with new weapons and participants.""[10] Medvedev's statement is a thinly veiled threat of possible Russian nuclear weapons use, the introduction of Russian allied forces in the war, or even Russian attacks against Europe. ISW continues to assess that the Kremlin is extremely unlikely to use nuclear weapons or to attack NATO states at this time.[11] Russia has demonstrated that it will not accept any terms less than Ukraine's full capitulation and would likely view any negotiations that do not fulfill these war aims as ""unsuccessful."" The threat that Russia could continue its war against Ukraine and even escalate it should Russia not achieve its goals mirrors Russian Presidential Aide Vladimir Medinsky's May 16 statement that Russia is ready to fight for ""however long it takes.""[12] Medvedev's threat is part of Russia's reflexive control campaign meant to push Ukraine and the West to accept Russia's demands for Ukrainian surrender. Russia continues to deny the current Ukrainian government's legitimacy and is likely setting conditions to renege on any future Ukrainian–Russian peace agreement. Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated on May 17 that it is important for Russia to understand exactly who from the Ukrainian government will sign the documents that may result from any future Russian-Ukrainian agreement.[13] Peskov's comments are likely part of the Kremlin's long-standing narrative rejecting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's legitimacy and the legitimacy of all post-2014 Ukrainian governments.[14] This rhetorical campaign is part of efforts to set conditions for Russia to withdraw from any future peace agreements at a time of Russia's choosing and to support Russia's repeated demand that Ukraine acquiesce to regime change and the installation of a pro-Russian proxy government.[15] Any future peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine must include Russia's explicit recognition of the Ukrainian government's and the Ukrainian Constitution's legitimacy. Key Takeaways: The Russian delegation in Istanbul reportedly framed its demands for a final peace settlement as preconditions that Ukraine must meet before Russia will agree to a ceasefire. Most of Russia's demands are contrary to US President Donald Trump's proposed peace plan.

Russia's continued protraction of negotiations emphasizes its unwillingness to engage in good-faith negotiations for either a ceasefire or a final peace agreement.

Kremlin officials continue to signal that Russia is prepared to continue or even escalate its war against Ukraine should Ukraine and the West not agree to Russia's demands for Ukraine's surrender.

Ukrainian and Russian delegations met in Istanbul on May 16 but made little progress towards agreeing to a full ceasefire or a peace settlement to Russia's war against Ukraine. The Russian delegation reportedly formally demanded that Ukraine cede territory to which Russia has informally been laying claim, while asserting that Russia is ready to continue the war for years. Russia may again formalize previously informal territorial claims in the future as part of Russia's effort to secure full Ukrainian capitulation. Turkish, Ukrainian, and American delegations met on the morning of May 16 in Istanbul, after which Turkish, Ukrainian, and Russian delegations met.[1] Russian Presidential Aide Vladimir Medinsky, the head of the Russian delegation, likely met with US State Department Director of Policy Planning Staff Michael Anton before the Ukrainian-Russian meeting.[2] The Ukrainian delegation, including Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha, and Presidential Administration Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak, met with US Special Envoy to Ukraine General Keith Kellogg, UK National Security Advisor Jonathan Powell, French Presidential Foreign Policy Advisor Emmanuel Bonn, and German Chancellor's Advisor for Foreign and Security Policy Gunter Sautter to coordinate positions before the Ukrainian-Russian meeting.[3] Umerov and Medinsky announced that Ukraine and Russia would exchange 1,000 prisoners of war (POWs) each in the near future.[4] Medinsky stated that the Russian and Ukrainian delegations agreed to ""write...down in detail"" and present their visions for a possible future ceasefire and that bilateral negotiations will continue after this presentation.[5] Kremlin newswire TASS reported that an unspecified source stated that there was no specific date set for Russia and Ukraine to exchange their ceasefire plans.[6] Medinsky highlighted that Russia is prepared to continue its war in Ukraine for years to come. Medinsky claimed that those ""who do not know history"" say that there should be a ceasefire first, then negotiations to achieve peace.[7] Medinsky claimed that war and negotiations should be conducted simultaneously, and Carroll reported that Medinsky stated that Russia is ""ready to fight for a year, two, three – however long it takes.""[8] Medinsky reportedly referenced the Great Northern War (1700-1721) when asking ""how long [is Ukraine] ready to fight?"" and claimed that ""Russia is prepared to fight forever.""[9] Russia state media confirmed that Medinsky spoke about the 18th-century war with Sweden during the meeting.[10] Ukrainian diplomatic sources told various Western and Ukrainian outlets that the Russian delegation made ""unrealistic"" and ""unacceptable"" demands that went ""far beyond"" any demands Russia has previously discussed.[11] The delegation reportedly repeated the Kremlin's demand that Ukrainian forces withdraw from the entirety of the illegally annexed Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhia, and Kherson oblasts before the start of a ceasefire. The Economist foreign correspondent Oliver Carroll reported that a source stated that the Russian delegation additionally threatened to seize Kharkiv and Sumy oblasts, and Ukrainian Verkhovna Rada Deputy Oleksiy Goncharenko similarly reported that the Russian delegation threatened to annex Sumy Oblast in order to create a ""security zone.""[12] The Kremlin has repeatedly publicly demanded that Ukraine cede all of Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhia, and Kherson oblasts – even the territory that Russian forces currently do not occupy – but had not formally demanded that Ukraine cede all of Kharkiv and Sumy oblasts before the May 16 Istanbul meeting.[13] Russian officials have informally claimed all of Kharkiv Oblast as part of Russia and launched offensive operations to create buffer zones in Kharkiv and Sumy Oblasts in May 2024 and March 2025, respectively, that are likely part of Russian territorial expansion efforts, however. Kharkiv Oblast occupation governor Vitaly Ganchev claimed in early February 2025 that Kharkiv Oblast is ""strategically"" and politically significant for Russia and that he was ""certain"" that Russian forces would seize all of Kharkiv Oblast because Russia needed a ""sanitary zone"" to protect itself from Ukrainian shelling.[14] Ganchev further claimed that Kharkiv Oblast would have held a ""referendum"" to become the ""fifth oblast to join Russia"" in September 2022 had it not been for the successful Ukrainian counteroffensive in Kharkiv Oblast at that time. Russian forces launched attacks across the Sumy-Kursk Oblast border in April 2025 to create a buffer zone and possibly press further toward Sumy City in order to expand Russian territorial demands in Ukraine.[15] Russian forces similarly launched offensive operations in May 2024 to create a buffer zone in northern Kharkiv Oblast, and Russian Security Council Deputy Chairperson Dmitry Medvedev stated at that time that Russia's envisioned ""buffer zone"" should encompass all of Ukraine, suggesting that the Kremlin's concept of the buffer zone is a thinly veiled justification for Russia's intent to subsume larger portions of Ukraine.[16] Russian officials have long been informally laying claim to additional territories in Ukraine beyond Sumy, Kharkiv, Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhia, and Kherson oblasts. Russian officials, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, have consistently claimed that ""Novorossiya"" – an invented region of Ukraine that Kremlin officials have claimed includes all southern and eastern Ukraine – is an ""integral"" part of Russia and that Odesa City is a ""Russian"" city.""[17] Novorossiya geographically encompasses Kharkiv Oblast. Kherson Oblast occupation head Vladimir Saldo stated in April 2025 that the ""return"" of the west (right) bank of the Dnipro River to Russia is ""fundamentally important"" and an ""absolute priority.""[18] Saldo called for Russia to completely control the areas of the Dnipro River that pass through Kherson, Zaporizhia, and Dnipropetrovsk oblasts – a call for Russia to not only gain control over parts of Kherson and Zaporizhia oblasts that Russian forces do not currently occupy but to control parts of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, which Russia has not formally claimed or illegally annexed. The Kremlin may increasingly adopt this pattern of informally discussing additional Russian territorial claims and then formally introducing these claims as demands in peace negotiations in the future. ISW has consistently assessed that Russian President Vladimir Putin will not compromise in peace negotiations unless Ukraine and the West inflict significant battlefield and economic losses on Russia and force Putin to rethink his theory of victory. Putin articulated his theory of victory for his war in Ukraine in June 2024, which posits that Russia will be able to win a war of attrition against Ukraine by continuing gradual, creeping advances indefinitely and preventing Ukraine from conducting successful, operationally significant counteroffensive operations, assuming Russia’s war effort outlasts Western support for Ukraine.[19] ISW previously assessed that Russia faces a number of compounding materiel, defense industrial, manpower, and economic issues that threaten Russia's ability to continue the war in Ukraine in the long term.[20] Putin is likely prioritizing dividing Ukraine's Western allies and weakening Western support to Ukraine in order to secure his desired end state in negotiations, rather than effectively addressing Russia's domestic problems. Putin’s decision to intensify offensive operations throughout Ukraine in March and April 2025 is only exacerbating these issues and underscores his commitment to pressuring Ukraine in negotiations. ISW continues to assess that increased Western – especially US – military aid and economic sanctions are necessary to enable Ukraine to inflict significant battlefield losses on Russia and force Putin to either change his theory of victory or make an economically painful and unpopular decision to implement another partial involuntary reserve call-up. Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly approved a series of command changes in the Russian military, including a new Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Ground Forces. Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on May 15 to appoint former Commander-in-Chief of the Ground Forces General Oleg Salyukov as Deputy Secretary of the Russian Security Council.[21] Kremlin-affiliated outlet Izvestia, citing an unspecified source, reported on May 15 that the Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) appointed Colonel General Andrei Mordvichev as Commander-in-Chief of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces to replace Salyukov.[22] Mordvichev most recently served as the commander of both the Russian Central Grouping of Forces and Central Military District (CMD) and oversaw Russia's seizure of Avdiivka in February 2024.[23] Russian milbloggers claimed that the Russian MoD also appointed Colonel General Valery Solodchuk as the new CMD commander, and Russian outlet Ura reported that a high-ranking source in Russian military circles confirmed these reports.[24] Solodchuk most recently served as commander of the Kursk Grouping of Forces and led Russia's efforts to eliminate the Ukrainian salient in Kursk Oblast.[25] Russian insider sources and milbloggers welcomed Mordvichev's appointment and interpreted it as a sign that the Kremlin is initiating a modernization effort to enhance Russia's ability to plan and execute operations in Ukraine and beyond.[26] The Kremlin is likely appointing Mordvichev to proliferate positional warfare tactics and operational concepts for grinding marginal advances – the main tactics Russian forces used in the Avdiivka-Pokrovsk direction – across Russia’s Ground Forces. Mordvichev’s appointment indicates that the Kremlin approves of the tactics developed under Mordvichev’s command – namely, the use of grinding, highly attritional, infantry-led assaults – and aims to institutionalize these tactics that the CMD used to advance in the Avdiivka-Pokrovsk direction since late 2023. Mordvichev is one of the few Russian commanders to have achieved tactical penetrations of the Ukrainian line in the last two years and one of Russia’s most celebrated commanders at the moment, but these limited tactical penetrations have come at great costs.[27] Russian forces suffered significant personnel and equipment losses in exchange for approximately 60 kilometers of penetration since elements of the CMD first redeployed to the Avdiivka-Pokrovsk direction in October 2023.[28] Mordvichev’s appointment is likely also an effort to distill lessons learned and tactics from the CMD to the rest of the Russian military, as ISW has previously observed Russian units in the Kupyansk and Velyka Novosilka directions implementing the attritional assaults that the CMD utilized to seize Avdiivka in February 2024.[29] Russian forces are continuing to expand their salient northeast of Pokrovsk and southwest of Toretsk, although it remains unclear whether the Russian military command will prioritize further advances towards Kostyantynivka or Pokrovsk during Summer 2025. Geolocated footage published on May 16 indicates that Russian forces recently advanced in northern Myrolyubivka (east of Pokrovsk) and seized Myrolyubivka and Mykhailivka (just west of Myrolyubivka).[30] Russian milbloggers claimed on May 16 that Russian forces advanced further north and southwest of Myrolyubivka and northwest of Hrodivka (east of Pokrovsk).[31] The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) credited elements of the Russian 5th Motorized Rifle Brigade (51st Combined Arms Army [CAA], formerly 1st Donetsk People’s Republic Army Corps [DNR AC], Southern Military District [SMD]) with seizing Myrolyubivka, and a Kremlin-affiliated milblogger insinuated that the 5th Motorized Rifle Brigade is subordinated to the Central Grouping of Forces.[32] The brigade was likely previously subordinated under the Southern Grouping of Forces, as the Russian military command redeployed elements of the 5th Motorized Rifle Brigade from the Kurakhove direction to reinforce offensive operations near Vozdvyzhenka (east of Pokrovsk) in January 2025.[33] ISW has not observed reports of the brigade engaged in combat since March 2025, however. Elements of the 5th Motorized Rifle Brigade and other elements of the 51st CAA appeared to culminate in Toretsk in February and March 2025, but the brigade may be reentering combat after a period of rest and reconstitution. Ukrainian military observer Kostyantyn Mashovets stated on May 16 that Ukrainian forces maintain some positions near and within Yelyzavetivka (east of Myrolyubivka) that are complicating Russian advances towards Myrnohrad (west of Yelyzavetivka and just east of Pokrovsk) and Pokrovsk.[34] Russian milbloggers also recently acknowledged that Ukrainian forces maintain positions north of Yalyzvetivka, and ISW is therefore expanding Ukrainian advances in the area, although these advances are likely not recent.[35] Mashovets stated that elements of the Russian 20th Motorized Rifle Division (8th CAA, SMD) and 51st CAA are attempting to advance from Malynivka toward Novoekonomichne and north of Nova Poltavka (all northeast of Pokrovsk) in order to force Ukrainian forces to withdraw from Yelyzavetivka and to envelop Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad.[36] Russian forces have recently intensified offensive operations northeast and east of Pokrovsk after largely abandoning this area in favor of advances further northeast of Pokrovsk toward Kostyantynivka and southwest of Pokrovsk toward Novopavlivka in early 2024.[37] Ukrainian officials recently reported that Russia is reinforcing its units in the Pokrovsk direction, and ISW recently observed reports that elements of the Russian 39th Motorized Rifle Brigade (68th Army Corps [AC], Eastern Military District [EMD]) recently redeployed from the Kurakhove direction to near Malynivka.[38] These recent redeployments and the reported appointment of Valery Solodchuk as Central Military District (CMD) commander after his recent success in Kursk Oblast indicate that the Russian military command may refocus on the seizure of Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad in the coming weeks and months. ISW previously assessed that Russian forces may attempt to advance along the Vozdvyzhenka-Yelyzavetivka-Myrne-Razine line to envelop Pokrovsk instead of fighting through the more urban and heavily defended settlements of Novoekonomichne and Myrnohrad closer to Pokrovsk.[39] The Russian military command may redeploy forces from Kursk Oblast or additional elements of the 51st CAA to the CMD’s area of responsibility (AoR) around Pokrovsk and reintensify efforts to advance west of Pokrovsk should the Russian military command prioritize seizing Pokrovsk over pushing further toward Kostyantynivka from the southwest during Summer 2025. The Russian military command may alternatively choose to continue prioritizing advances toward Kostyantynivka in Summer 2025. Russian forces intensified offensive operations aimed at eliminating the Ukrainian pocket southwest of Toretsk in February and March 2025, and recent Russian advances into Novoolenivka and near Zorya (both southwest of Toretsk) will likely force Ukrainian forces to withdraw from their limited positions remaining in the pocket in the near future.[40] Mashovets stated that Russian forces are currently attempting to attack along the T-0504 Pokrovsk-Kostyantynivka highway toward Stepanivka (northwest of Toretsk) and Yablunivka (west of Toretsk).[41] Mashovets stated that elements of the 20th Motorized Rifle Division are the main force attacking between Stara Mykolaivka (southwest of Toretsk) and Nova Poltavka and that elements of the 150th Motorized Rifle Division (8th CAA) are attacking in other areas southwest of Toretsk, including toward Romanivka.[42] ISW previously assessed that Russian forces likely intend to leverage advances southwest of Toretsk to push along the H-20 Donetsk City-Kostyantynivka highway and facilitate deeper advances northeast of Pokrovsk along the T-0504 Pokrovsk-Kostyantynivka highway toward Kostyantynivka.[43] ISW recently observed reports that elements of the Russian 42nd Motorized Rifle Division (58th Combined Arms Army [CAA], Southern Military District [SMD]) redeployed from western Zaporizhia Oblast to the Stara Mykolaivka area and that unspecified drone operators recently redeployed from the Kursk direction to near Kalynove (south of Stara Mykolaivka).[44] The Russian military command may continue to reinforce the Russian force grouping southwest of Toretsk and attempt to advance further along the H-20 Donetsk City-Kostyantynivka highway toward Oleksandro-Kalynove (west of Toretsk) in the coming weeks if they intend to prioritize offensive operations against Kostyantynivka in Summer 2025. Russia is unlikely to have sufficient manpower, materiel, and operational planning capabilities to conduct both an envelopment of Pokrovsk and a significant offensive operation toward Kostyantynivka in the coming months. Russian advances southwest of Toretsk currently support both of these efforts, but the Russian military command will likely have to choose to prioritize one direction in the coming weeks due to near-term constraints in Russia’s manpower and materiel reserves.[45] Recent ",,https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/themes/isw/isw.ico

What action can Israel’s allies take over its expansion of military operations in Gaza?,2025-05-23T16:00:34+00:00,https://theconversation.com/what-action-can-israels-allies-take-over-its-expansion-of-military-operations-in-gaza-257154,"The British, French and Canadian leaders issued a joint statement on May 19 in which they condemned Israel’s “egregious actions” in Gaza, warning that concrete action could follow if it does not stop its military offensive. They said an 11-week blockade on humanitarian aid reaching the territory had led to an “intolerable” level of human suffering.

Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu – who the International Criminal Court (ICC) alleges is responsible for war crimes in Gaza – responded angrily. He accused the leaders in London, Ottawa and Paris of offering Hamas a “huge prize” for its October 7 attack on Israel.

This drew a rebuttal from the British foreign secretary, David Lammy, who declared that “opposing the expansion of a war that’s killed thousands of children is not rewarding Hamas”. So, what action can Israel’s western allies take over its offensive in Gaza?

The most realistic option is probably the recognition of Palestinian statehood. The Netanyahu government has expressed fierce opposition to the establishment of a Palestinian state, saying recently it would be a “win for terrorism”.

But this recognition would send a strong message of support for a two-state solution, which most of the world has long seen as the only way to end the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. And the UK, along with Canada, has said it is joining a French initiative to recognise Palestine as a state at a June conference in New York, organised to advance a two-state solution.

By doing so, the UK, France and Canada would join 160 states that already recognise Palestine. These include 11 states in the EU: Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Ireland, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden.

Stop selling arms

Another option is for western states to stop selling arms to Israel. France has done this already. And the British government partially suspended arms exports to Israel in September 2024 over concerns they could be used unlawfully in Gaza.

However, in the three months that followed, the government reportedly approved US$169 million (£126 million) worth of military equipment to Israel. This is more than the total amount it approved between 2020 and 2023.

The UK maintains that its “exports of military goods to Israel are low”, and the same is true for Canada. The UK and Canada together provide less than 1% of the annual value of Israel’s military imports. But a full suspension would be a major political statement, demonstrating diminishing international support for Israel’s military offensive in Gaza.

For a total ban to have any effect on the Israeli military’s operations, it needs to be complemented by similar action from more significant arms providers. Germany, for instance, accounted for 30% of Israel’s arms imports between 2019 and 2023.

The UK and Canada are also part of the global F-35 jet fighter programme, with the UK alone supplying 15% of the value of each jet. F-35 jets play a key role in Israel’s military operations in Gaza. But stopping British-made parts for F-35s from being supplied to Israel is unlikely.

It would involve pulling out of the entire programme, which the government says is crucial for international security. However, given the High Court is hearing a case that alleges the sale of components for F-35s indirectly to Israel breaks domestic and international law, its stance could change.

Western countries could also suspend their trade with Israel. The EU accounts for almost 30% of Israeli exports, with a similar amount of Israeli imports coming from the EU. The UK is the 11th-largest importer of Israeli goods.

This option would have a significant impact on Israel’s economy, and is being considered by both the UK and EU. On May 20, Lammy announced the suspension of negotiations over a new free trade deal between the UK and Israel. And the EU has said it will review its trade association deal with Israel, after 17 of the bloc’s 27 foreign ministers backed the move.

A complete suspension of the EU’s trade agreement with Israel would require unanimity, so it is unlikely. But a partial suspension is possible, as this would only require at least 55% of member states to vote in favour.

Sanction Israeli settlers

One more option is the expansion – and coordination – of efforts to sanction Israeli nationals who promote violence against Palestinians. In 2024, France, Canada and the EU imposed financial sanctions and travel bans against extremist Israeli settlers who had been found guilty of using violence against Palestinian civilians in the West Bank.

The UK has now taken a similar approach, introducing sanctions on several individuals and entities involved in the Israeli settler movement. This includes prominent Israeli settler Daniella Weiss, who featured in Louis Theroux’s recent documentary, The Settlers. Weiss has dismissed the sanctions, saying they will not affect her or the broader settler movement.

Britain’s government is also reportedly considering sanctions against Israel’s finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, and national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir. Lammy referred to Smotrich’s recent comments that the Israeli military offensive will be “destroying everything that’s left” of Gaza as “monstrous”.

Sanctions could, in theory, be complemented by bans on the import of goods from Israeli settlements. Israel’s finance ministry says that 2.5% of the country’s agricultural exports and 1.5% of industrial exports to the EU originate in settlements.

This type of ban would be difficult for France to introduce due to EU law, but it might not be impossible. Ireland is also trying to ban the trade of goods from such settlements.

Above all, Israel’s allies should step up their efforts to respect international law. In November 2024, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Netanyahu over alleged war crimes relating to the Gaza war.

The UK and Canada have said they would arrest Netanyahu if he travels to either country – and they could apply pressure on France to join them. France has not said whether it would arrest Netanyahu if he sets foot on French territory.

The humanitarian situation in Gaza is likely to worsen over the coming weeks and months. If Israel’s western allies want to use their influence to force the Israeli government to end the conflict, now is the time.",Catherine Gegout,https://images.theconversation.com/files/669987/original/file-20250523-62-mc18wo.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C778%2C8100%2C4050&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop
List of military engagements during the Gaza war,Published date not found (newspaper3k),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_military_engagements_during_the_Gaza_war,"This is a list of notable engagements during the Gaza war, encompassing land, naval, and air engagements, covering events which took place or began during the October 7 attack and immediately afterwards, including Israel's declaration of war on 8 October, the imposition of the 2023 Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip, and active operations in the Gaza Strip. It also covers other engagements in and around Israel directly related to its conflict in Gaza, including Israel's operations in occupied West Bank and southern Syria, support for Palestinian militiants from Hezbollah in Southern Lebanon, and intensified attacks on commercial vehicles by Houthi movement in the Red Sea.

Major conflicts by area

Hamas-led attack on Israel

Approximate presence of Hamas militiants (blue) on October 7-9, 2023

Early in the morning of 7 October 2023, approximately 3000 militants,[11][12] from Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the PFLP, and DFLP,[13] breached the Gaza fence and attacked multiple locations in Southern Israel.[11][12] After the IDF repelled most of the attacks, the militiants retreated back into Gaza Strip with multiple hostages captured.

Battles

Invasion of the Gaza Strip

After the attack carried out by Hamas militiants, Israeli government declared war to Hamas and began preparing its counter-attack, which began on 27 October.[42] Prior to that, the IDF launched a series of airstrikes throughout the territory and blockaded it, leaving no electricity or supply delivery tracks.[43][44]

Battles and offensives

Non-battle attacks

Incursions into West Bank

Alongside its invasion into Gaza Strip, Israel has carried out multiple attacks on the territory of Palestinian West Bank, which is partially occupied by the IDF.[112][113] The goal stated by Israel was to eliminate Hamas militiants which fled there from Gaza Strip. The Palestinian Authority, which has not proclaimed itself a supporter of the IDF, is also conducting operations against Hamas militias.[114][115]

West Bank campaigns

Attacks

Military conflict in Lebanon

Lebanese militiant group Hezbollah started launching rockets into Northern Israel and Golan Heights on October 8, 2023 to support Palestinian forces against Israel. In response, Israel bombed Southern Lebanon, the region of highest Hezbollah presence, as well as engaged in clashes with militiants close to the Israeli-Lebanese border.

For the current phase of the conflict beginning in October 2023, see Gaza war . For the wider regional conflict, see Arab–Israeli conflict

The Israeli–Palestinian conflict is an ongoing military and political conflict about land and self-determination within the territory of the former Mandatory Palestine.[28][29][30] Key aspects of the conflict include the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the status of Jerusalem, Israeli settlements, borders, security, water rights,[31] the permit regime in the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip, Palestinian freedom of movement,[32] and the Palestinian right of return.

The conflict has its origins in the rise of Zionism in the late 19th century in Europe, a movement which aimed to establish a Jewish state through the colonization of Palestine,[page needed][34] synchronously with the first arrival of Jewish settlers to Ottoman Palestine in 1882. The Zionist movement garnered the support of an imperial power in the 1917 Balfour Declaration issued by Britain, which promised to support the creation of a ""Jewish homeland"" in Palestine. Following British occupation of the formerly Ottoman region during World War I, Mandatory Palestine was established as a British mandate. Increasing Jewish immigration led to tensions between Jews and Arabs which grew into intercommunal conflict.[36][37] In 1936, an Arab revolt erupted demanding independence and an end to British support for Zionism, which was suppressed by the British.[38][39] Eventually tensions led to the United Nations adopting a partition plan in 1947, triggering a civil war.

During the ensuing 1948 Palestine war, more than half of the mandate's predominantly Palestinian Arab population fled or were expelled by Israeli forces. By the end of the war, Israel was established on most of the former mandate's territory, and the Gaza Strip and the West Bank were controlled by Egypt and Jordan respectively.[40][41] Since the 1967 Six-Day War, Israel has been occupying the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, known collectively as the Palestinian territories. Two Palestinian uprisings against Israel and its occupation erupted in 1987 and 2000, the first and second intifadas respectively. Israel's occupation resulted in Israel constructing illegal settlements there, creating a system of institutionalized discrimination against Palestinians under its occupation called Israeli apartheid. This discrimination includes Israel's denial of Palestinian refugees from their right of return and right to their lost properties. Israel has also drawn international condemnation for violating the human rights of the Palestinians.[42]

The international community, with the exception of the United States and Israel, has been in consensus since the 1980s regarding a settlement of the conflict on the basis of a two-state solution along the 1967 borders and a just resolution for Palestinian refugees. The United States and Israel have instead preferred bilateral negotiations rather than a resolution of the conflict on the basis of international law. In recent years, public support for a two-state solution has decreased, with Israeli policy reflecting an interest in maintaining the occupation rather than seeking a permanent resolution to the conflict. In 2007, Israel tightened its blockade of the Gaza Strip and made official its policy of isolating it from the West Bank. Since then, Israel has framed its relationship with Gaza in terms of the laws of war rather than in terms of its status as an occupying power. In a July 2024 ruling, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) rebuffed Israel's stance, determining that the Palestinian territories constitute one political unit and that Israel continues to illegally occupy the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The ICJ also determined that Israeli policies violate the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. Since 2006, Hamas and Israel have fought several wars. Attacks by Hamas-led armed groups in October 2023 in Israel were followed by another war.[43] Israel's actions in Gaza since the start of the war have been described by international law experts, genocide scholars and human rights organizations as genocidal.[44]

History

Palestinian Arab-Christian-owned newspaper Falastin, 18 June 1936, caricatured Zionism as a crocodile, protected by a British officer, telling Palestinian Arabs: ""Don't be afraid! I will swallow you peacefully..."" [ 45 ]

The Israeli–Palestinian conflict began in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with the development of political Zionism and the arrival of Zionist settlers to Palestine.[46] During the early 20th century, Arab nationalism also grew within the Ottoman Empire. To gain support from the Arab nationalists in the war against the Ottoman Empire, Great Britain promised support for the formation of an independent Arab state in Palestine in the McMahon–Hussein correspondence.[47] The British Empire supplied a large amount of weapons to the Arab revolt 1916-1918.[48] With support from the Arab revolt the British Empire defeated the Ottoman's forces and took control of Palestine, Jordan and Syria. It later transpired that the British and French governments had secretly made the Sykes-Picot Agreement in 1916 not to allow the formation of an independent Arab state.[49] In July 1920, the short-lived Arab Kingdom of Syria, with Emir Faisal (one of the leaders of the Arab Revolt) as king and tolerated by Britain, was crushed by French armed forces, equipped with modern artillery.

While Jewish colonization began during this period, it was not until the arrival of more ideologically Zionist immigrants in the decade preceding the First World War that the landscape of Ottoman Palestine would start to significantly change.[50] Land purchases, the eviction of tenant Arab peasants and armed confrontation with Jewish para-military units would all contribute to the Palestinian population's growing fear of territorial displacement and dispossession.[41] From early on, the leadership of the Zionist movement had the idea of ""transferring"" (a euphemism for ethnic cleansing) the Arab Palestinian population out of the land for the purpose of establishing a Jewish demographic majority.[51][52][53][54][55] According to the Israeli historian Benny Morris the idea of transfer was ""inevitable and inbuilt into Zionism"".[56] The Arab population felt this threat as early as the 1880s with the arrival of the first aliyah.[41] Chaim Weizmann's efforts to build British support for the Zionist movement would eventually secure the Balfour Declaration, a public statement issued by the British government in 1917 during the First World War announcing support for the establishment of a ""national home for the Jewish people"" in Palestine.[57]

1920s

With the creation of the British Mandate in Palestine after the end of the first world war, large-scale Jewish immigration began accompanied by the development of a separate Jewish-controlled sector of the economy supported by foreign capital.[58] The more ardent Zionist ideologues of the Second Aliyah would become the leaders of the Yishuv starting in the 1920s and believed in the separation of Jewish and Arab societies.

Amin al-Husseini, appointed as Grand Mufti of Jerusalem by the British High Commissioner Herbert Samuel, immediately marked Jewish national movement and Jewish immigration to Palestine as the sole enemy to his cause,[59] initiating large-scale riots against the Jews as early as 1920 in Jerusalem and in 1921 in Jaffa. Among the results of the violence was the establishment of the Jewish paramilitary force Haganah. In 1929, a series of violent riots resulted in the deaths of 133 Jews and 116 Arabs, with significant Jewish casualties in Hebron and Safed, and the evacuation of Jews from Hebron and Gaza.[60]

1936–1939 Arab revolt

The Arab revolt of 1936–1939 in Palestine, motivated by opposition to mass Jewish immigration allowed by the British Mandatory authorities.

In the early 1930s, the Arab national struggle in Palestine had drawn many Arab nationalist militants from across the Middle East, such as Sheikh Izz ad-Din al-Qassam from Syria, who established the Black Hand militant group and had prepared the grounds for the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine. Following the death of al-Qassam at the hands of the British in late 1935, tensions erupted in 1936 into the Arab general strike and general boycott. The strike soon deteriorated into violence, and the Arab revolt was bloodily repressed by the British assisted by the British armed forces of the Jewish Settlement Police, the Jewish Supernumerary Police, and Special Night Squads.[61] The suppression of the revolt would leave at least 10% of the adult male population killed, wounded, imprisoned or exiled.[62] Between the expulsion of much of the Arab leadership and the weakening of the economy, the Palestinians would struggle to confront the growing Zionist movement.[63]

The cost and risks associated with the revolt and the ongoing inter-communal conflict led to a shift in British policies in the region and the appointment of the Peel Commission which recommended creation of a small Jewish country, which the two main Zionist leaders, Chaim Weizmann and David Ben-Gurion, accepted on the basis that it would allow for later expansion.[64][65][66] The subsequent White Paper of 1939, which rejected a Jewish state and sought to limit Jewish immigration to the region, was the breaking point in relations between British authorities and the Zionist movement.[67]

1940–1947

The renewed violence, which continued sporadically until the beginning of World War II, ended with around 5,000 casualties on the Arab side and 700 combined on the British and Jewish side total.[68][69][70] With the eruption of World War II, the situation in Mandatory Palestine calmed down. It allowed a shift towards a more moderate stance among Palestinian Arabs under the leadership of the Nashashibi clan and even the establishment of the Jewish–Arab Palestine Regiment under British command, fighting Germans in North Africa. The more radical exiled faction of al-Husseini, however, tended to cooperate with Nazi Germany, and participated in the establishment of a pro-Nazi propaganda machine throughout the Arab world. The defeat of Arab nationalists in Iraq and subsequent relocation of al-Husseini to Nazi-occupied Europe tied his hands regarding field operations in Palestine, though he regularly demanded that the Italians and the Germans bomb Tel Aviv.[60] The Jewish Agency for Palestine and Palestinian National Defense Party called on Palestine's Jewish and Arab youth to volunteer for the British Army. 30,000 Palestinian Jews and 12,000 Palestinian Arabs enlisted in the British armed forces during the war, while a Jewish Brigade was created in 1944.[71]

By the end of World War II, a crisis over the fate of Holocaust survivors from Europe led to renewed tensions between the Yishuv and Mandate authorities. By 1944, Jewish groups began to conduct military-style operations against the British, with the aim of persuading Great Britain to accept the formation of a Jewish state. This culminated in the Jewish insurgency in Mandatory Palestine. This sustained Zionist paramilitary campaign of resistance against British authorities, along with the increased illegal immigration of Jewish refugees and 1947 United Nations partition, led to eventual withdrawal of the British from Palestine.[72]

1947 United Nations partition plan

On 29 November 1947, the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted Resolution 181(II)[73] recommending the adoption and implementation of a plan to partition Palestine into an Arab state, a Jewish state and the City of Jerusalem.[74] Palestinian Arabs were opposed to the partition.[75] Zionists accepted the partition but planned to expand Israel's borders beyond what was allocated to it by the UN.[76] On the next day, Palestine was swept by violence, igniting the first phase of the Palestine War. For four months, under continuous Arab provocation and attack, the Yishuv was usually on the defensive while occasionally retaliating.[77] The Arab League supported the Arab struggle by forming the volunteer-based Arab Liberation Army, supporting the Palestinian Arab Army of the Holy War, under the leadership of Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni and Hasan Salama. On the Jewish side, the civil war was managed by the major underground militias – the Haganah, Irgun and Lehi – strengthened by numerous Jewish veterans of World War II and foreign volunteers. By spring 1948, it was already clear that the Arab forces were nearing a total collapse, while Yishuv forces gained more and more territory, creating a large scale refugee problem of Palestinian Arabs.[60]

1948 Arab–Israeli War

Land in the lighter shade represents territory within the borders of Israel at the conclusion of the 1948 war. This land is internationally recognized as belonging to Israel.

Following the Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel on 14 May 1948, the Arab League decided to intervene on behalf of Palestinian Arabs, marching their forces into former British Palestine, beginning the main phase of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.[74] The overall fighting, leading to around 15,000 casualties, resulted in cease-fire and armistice agreements of 1949, with Israel holding much of the former Mandate territory, Jordan occupying and later annexing the West Bank and Egypt taking over the Gaza Strip, where the All-Palestine Government was declared by the Arab League on 22 September 1948.[61] The 1947–1948 civil war in Mandatory Palestine and 1948 Arab-Israeli War resulted in the ethnic cleansing of 750,000 Palestinian Arabs.[40] In 1950, Israel passed the Law of Return, which allowed Jews and their spouses to become citizens with voting rights, even if they had never lived there before.

1956 Suez Crisis

Through the 1950s, Jordan and Egypt supported the Palestinian Fedayeen militants' cross-border attacks into Israel, while Israel carried out its own reprisal operations in the host countries. The 1956 Suez Crisis resulted in a short-term Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip and exile of the All-Palestine Government, which was later restored with Israeli withdrawal. The All-Palestine Government was completely abandoned by Egypt in 1959 and was officially merged into the United Arab Republic, to the detriment of the Palestinian national movement. Gaza Strip then was put under the authority of the Egyptian military administrator, making it a de facto military occupation. In 1964, however, a new organization, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), was established by Yasser Arafat.[74] It immediately won the support of most Arab League governments and was granted a seat in the Arab League.

1967 Six-Day War

In the 1967 Arab-Israel War, Israel occupied the Palestinian West Bank, East Jerusalem, Gaza Strip, Egyptian Sinai, Syrian Golan Heights, and two islands in the Gulf of Aqaba.

The war exerted a significant effect upon Palestinian nationalism, as the PLO was unable to establish any control on the ground and ultimately established its headquarters in Jordan, from where it supported the Jordanian army during the War of Attrition. However, the Palestinian base in Jordan collapsed with the Jordanian–Palestinian civil war in 1970, after which the PLO was forced to relocate to South Lebanon.

In the mid-1970s, the international community converged on a framework to resolve the conflict through the establishment of an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza. This ""land for peace"" proposal was endorsed by the ICJ and UN.[78]

1973 Yom Kippur War

On 6 October 1973, a coalition of Arab forces consisting of mainly Egypt and Syria launched a surprise attack against Israel on the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur. Despite this, the war concluded with an Israeli victory, with both sides suffering tremendous casualties.

Following the end of the war, the UN Security Council passed Resolution 338 confirming the land-for-peace principle established in Resolution 242, initiating the Middle East peace process. The Arab defeat would play an important role in the PLO's willingness to pursue a negotiated settlement to the conflict,[79][80] while many Israelis began to believe that the area under Israeli occupation could not be held indefinitely by force.[81][82]

The Camp David Accords, agreed upon by Israel and Egypt in 1978, primarily aimed to establish a peace treaty between the two countries. The accords also proposed the creation of a ""Self-Governing Authority"" for the Arab population in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, excluding Jerusalem, under Israeli control. A peace treaty based on these accords was signed in 1979, leading to Israel's withdrawal from the occupied Egyptian Sinai Peninsula by 1982.[83][84]

1982 Lebanon War

During the Lebanese Civil War, Palestinian militants continued to launch attacks against Israel while also battling opponents within Lebanon. In 1978, the Coastal Road massacre led to the Israeli full-scale invasion known as Operation Litani. This operation sought to dislodge the PLO from Lebanon while expanding the area under the control of the Israeli allied Christian militias in southern Lebanon. The operation succeeded in leaving a large portion of the south in control of the Israeli proxy which would eventually form the South Lebanon Army. Under United States pressure, Israeli forces would eventually withdraw from Lebanon.[85][86][87][88]

In 1982, Israel, having secured its southern border with Egypt, sought to resolve the Palestinian issue by attempting to dismantle the military and political power of the PLO in Lebanon.[89] The goal was to establish a friendly regime in Lebanon and continue its policy of settlement and annexation in occupied Palestine.[90][91][92] The PLO had observed the latest ceasefire with Israel and shown a preference for negotiations over military operations. As a result, Israel sought to remove the PLO as a potential negotiating partner.[93][94][95] Most Palestinian militants were defeated within several weeks, Beirut was captured, and the PLO headquarters were evacuated to Tunisia in June by Yasser Arafat's decision.[61]

First Intifada (1987–1993)

Protests in the Gaza Strip in the early days of the First Intifada in 1987.

The first Palestinian uprising began in 1987 as a response to Israel's military occupation, escalating attacks on Palestinians, and policies of settlement building and collective punishment. The uprising largely consisted of nonviolent acts of civil disobedience and protest, and was largely led by grassroots popular, youth, and women's committees.[96][97] By the early 1990s, the conflict, termed the First Intifada, was the focus of international settlement efforts, in part motivated by the success of the Egyptian–Israeli peace treaty of 1982. Eventually the Israeli–Palestinian peace process led to the Oslo Accords of 1993, allowing the PLO to relocate from Tunisia and take ground in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, establishing the Palestinian National Authority. The peace process also had significant opposition among elements of Palestinian society, such as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, who immediately initiated a campaign of attacks targeting Israelis. Following hundreds of casualties and a wave of anti-government propaganda, Israeli Prime Minister Rabin was assassinated by an Israeli far-right extremist who objected to the peace initiative. This struck a serious blow to the peace process, which in 1996 led to the newly elected government of Israel backing off from the process, to some degree.[60]

Second Intifada (2000–2005)

Demonstrations against the construction of the West Bank separation barrier in the city of Bil'in, occupied West Bank, in 2005 during the Second Intifada.

Following several years of unsuccessful negotiations, the conflict re-erupted as the Second Intifada in September 2000.[61] The violence, escalating into an open conflict between the Palestinian National Security Forces and the Israel Defense Forces, lasted until 2004/2005 and led to thousands of fatalities. In 2005, Israeli Prime Minister Sharon ordered the removal of Israeli settlers and soldiers from Gaza. Israel and its Supreme Court formally declared an end to occupation, saying it ""had no effective control over what occurred"" in Gaza.[98] However, the United Nations, Human Rights Watch and many other international bodies and NGOs continue to consider Israel to be the occupying power of the Gaza Strip as Israel controls Gaza Strip's airspace, territorial waters and controls the movement of people or goods in or out of Gaza by air or sea.[98][99][100]

Fatah–Hamas split (2006–2007)

In 2006, Hamas won a plurality of 44% in the Palestinian parliamentary election. Israel responded it would begin economic sanctions unless Hamas agreed to accept prior Israeli–Palestinian agreements, forswear violence, and recognize Israel's right to exist, all of which Hamas rejected.[101] After internal Palestinian political struggle between Fatah and Hamas erupted into the 2007 Battle of Gaza, Hamas took full control of the area.[102] In 2007, Israel imposed a naval blockade on the Gaza Strip, and cooperation with Egypt allowed a ground blockade of the Egyptian border.

The tensions between Israel and Hamas escalated until late 2008, when Israel launched operation Cast Lead upon Gaza, resulting in thousands of civilian casualties and billions of dollars in damage. By February 2009, a ceasefire was signed with international mediation between the parties, though the occupation and small and sporadic eruptions of violence continued.[citation needed]

In 2011, a Palestinian Authority attempt to gain UN membership as a fully sovereign state failed. In Hamas-controlled Gaza, sporadic rocket attacks on Israel and Israeli air raids continued to occur.[103][104][105][106] In November 2012, Palestinian representation in the UN was upgraded to a non-member observer state, and its mission title was changed from ""Palestine (represented by PLO)"" to ""State of Palestine"". In 2014, another war broke out between Israel and Gaza, resulting in over 70 Israeli and over 2,000 Palestinian casualties.[107]

2023–present Gaza war

Map of the Gaza war in Gaza and southern Israel

After the 2014 war and 2021 crisis, Hamas began planning an attack on Israel.[108] In 2022, Netanyahu returned to power while headlining a hardline far-right government,[109] which led to greater political strife in Israel[110] and clashes in the Palestinian territories.[111] This culminated in a surprise attack launched by Hamas-led militant groups on southern Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October 2023, in which more than 1,200 Israeli civilians and military personnel were killed, and around 250 were taken hostage into Gaza.[112][113] The Israeli military retaliated by declaring war on Hamas and conducting an extensive aerial bombardment campaign on Gaza,[114] followed by a large-scale ground invasion with the stated goal of destroying Hamas, freeing hostages, and controlling security in Gaza afterwards.[115] Israel killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, including civilians and combatants and displaced almost two million people.[116] South Africa accused Israel of genocide at the International Court of Justice and called for an immediate ceasefire.[117] The court issued an order requiring Israel to take all measures to prevent any acts contrary to the 1948 Genocide Convention,[118][119][120] but did not order Israel to suspend its military campaign.[121]

The war spilled over, with Israel engaging in clashes with local militias in the West Bank, Hezbollah in Lebanon and northern Israel, and other Iranian-backed militias in Syria.[122][123][124] Iranian-backed militias also engaged in clashes with the United States,[125] while the Houthis blockaded the Red Sea in protest,[126] to which the United States responded with airstrikes in Yemen,[127] Iraq, and Syria.[128]

Attempts to reach a peaceful settlement

The PLO's participation in diplomatic negotiations was dependent on its complete disavowal of terrorism and recognition of Israel's ""right to exist."" This stipulation required the PLO to abandon its objective of reclaiming all of historic Palestine and instead focus on the 22 percent which came under Israeli military control in 1967.[129] By the late 1970s, Palestinian leadership in the occupied territories and most Arab states supported a two-state settlement.[130] In 1981, Saudi Arabia put forward a plan based on a two-state settlement to the conflict with support from the Arab League.[131] Israeli analyst Avner Yaniv describes Arafat as ready to make a historic compromise at this time, while the Israeli cabinet continued to oppose the existence of a Palestinian state. Yaniv described Arafat's willingness to compromise as a ""peace offensive"" which Israel responded to by planning to remove the PLO as a potential negotiating partner in order to evade international diplomatic pressure.[132] Israel would invade Lebanon the following year in an attempt to undermine the PLO as a political organization, weakening Palestinian nationalism and facilitating the annexation of the West Bank into Greater Israel.[91]

While the PLO had adopted a program of pursuing a Palestinian state alongside Israel since the mid-1970s, the 1988 Palestinian Declaration of Independence formally consecrated this objective. This declaration, which was based on resolutions from the Palestine National Council sessions in the late 1970s and 1980s, advocated for the creation of a Palestinian state comprising the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem, within the borders set by the 1949 armistice lines prior to 5 June 1967. Following the declaration, Arafat explicitly denounced all forms of terrorism and affirmed the PLO's acceptance of UN Resolutions 242 and 338, as well as the recognition of Israel's right to exist. All the conditions defined by Henry Kissinger for US negotiations with the PLO had now been met.[133]

Then-Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Shamir stood behind the stance that the PLO was a terrorist organization. He maintained a strict stance against any concessions, including withdrawal from occupied Palestinian territories, recognition of or negotiations with the PLO, and especially the establishment of a Palestinian state. Shamir viewed the U.S. decision to engage in dialogue with the PLO as a mistake that threatened the existing territorial status quo. He argued that negotiating with the PLO meant accepting the existence of a Palestinian state and hence was unacceptable.[134]

The peace process

The term ""peace process"" refers to the step-by-step approach to resolving the conflict. Having originally entered into usage to describe the US mediated negotiations between Israel and surrounding Arab countries, notably Egypt, the term ""peace-process"" has grown to be associated with an emphasis on the negotiation process rather than on presenting a comprehensive solution to the conflict.[135][136][137] As part of this process, fundamental issues of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict such as borders, access to resources, and the Palestinian right of return, have been left to ""final status"" talks. Such ""final status"" negotiations along the lines discussed in Madrid in 1991 have never taken place.[137]

The Oslo Accords of 1993 and 1995 built on the incremental framework put in place by the 1978 Camp David negotiations and the 1991 Madrid and Washington talks. The motivation behind the incremental approach towards a settlement was that it would ""build confidence"", but the eventual outcome was instead a dramatic decline in mutual confidence. At each incremental stage, Israel further entrenched its occupation of the Palestinian territories, despite the PA upholding its obligation to curbing violent attacks from extremist groups, in part by cooperating with Israeli forces.[138]

Meron Benvenisti, former deputy mayor of Jerusalem, observed that life became harsher for Palestinians during this period as state violence increased and Palestinian land continued to be expropriated as settlements expanded.[139][140][141][142] Israeli foreign minister Shlomo Ben-Ami described the Oslo Accords as legitimizing ""the transformation of the West Bank into what has been called a 'cartographic cheeseboard'.""[143]

Creation of the Palestinian Authority and security cooperation

Core to the Oslo Accords was the creation of the Palestinian Authority and the security cooperation it would enter into with the Israeli military authorities in what has been described as the ""outsourcing"" of the occupation to the PA.[129] Just before signing the Oslo accord, Rabin described the expectation that the ""Palestinians will be better at establishing internal security than we were, because they will allow no appeals to the Supreme Court and will prevent [human rights groups] from criticizing the conditions there.""[144] Along these lines, Ben-Ami, who participated in the Camp David 2000 talks, described this process: ""One of the meanings of Oslo was that the PLO was eventually Israel's collaborator in the task of stifling the Intifada and cutting short what was clearly an authentically democratic struggle for Palestinian independence.""[143]

The Wye River Memorandum agreed on by the PA and Israel introduced a ""zero tolerance"" policy for ""terror and violence."" This policy was uniformly criticised by human rights organizations for its ""encouragement"" of human rights abuses.[145][146] Dennis Ross describes the Wye as having successfully reduced both violent and non-violent protests, both of which he considers to be ""inconsistent with the spirit of Wye.""[147] Watson claims that the PA frequently violated its obligations to curb incitement[148] and its record on curbing terrorism and other security obligations under the Wye River Memorandum was, at best, mixed.[149]

Oslo Accords (1993, 1995)

In 1993, Israeli officials led by Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leaders from the Palestine Liberation Organization led by Yasser Arafat strove to find a peaceful solution through what became known as the Oslo peace process. A crucial milestone in this process was Arafat's letter of recognition of Israel's right to exist. Emblematic of the asymmetry in the Oslo process, Israel was not required to, and did not, recognize the right of a Palestinian state to exist. In 1993, the Declaration of Principles (or Oslo I) was signed and set forward a framework for future Israeli–Palestinian negotiations, in which key issues would be left to ""final status"" talks. The stipulations of the Oslo agreements ran contrary to the international consensus for resolving the conflict; the agreements did not uphold Palestinian self-determination or statehood and repealed the internationally accepted interpretation of UN Resolution 242 that land cannot be acquired by war.[140] With respect to access to land and resources, Noam Chomsky described the Oslo agreements as allowing ""Israel to do virtually what it likes.""[150] The Oslo process was delicate and progressed in fits and starts.

The process took a turning point at the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin in November 1995 and the election of Netanyahu in 1996, finally unraveling when Arafat and Ehud Barak failed to reach an agreement at Camp David in July 2000 and later at Taba in 2001.[135][151] The interim period specified by Oslo had not built confidence between the two parties; Barak had failed to implement additional stages of the interim agreements and settlements expanded by 10% during his short term.[152] The disagreement between the two parties at Camp David was primarily on the acceptance (or rejection) of international consensus.[153][154] For Palestinian negotiators, the international consensus, as represented by the yearly vote in the UN General Assembly which passes almost unanimously, was the starting point for negotiations. The Israeli negotiators, supported by the American participants, did not accept the international consensus as the basis for a settlement.[155] Both sides eventually accepted the Clinton parameters ""with reservations"" but the talks at Taba were ""called to a halt"" by Barak, and the peace process itself came to a stand-still.[151] Ben-Ami, who participated in the talks at Camp David as Israel's foreign minister, would later describe the proposal on the table: ""The Clinton parameters... are the best proof that Arafat was right to turn down the summit's offers"".[153]

Camp David Summit (2000)

In July 2000, US President Bill Clinton convened a peace summit between Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak. Barak reportedly put forward the following as ""bases for negotiation"", via the US to the Palestinian President: a non-militarized Palestinian state split into 3–4 parts containing 87–92% of the West Bank after having already given up 78% of historic Palestine.[h] Thus, an Israeli offer of 91 percent of the West Bank (5,538 km2 of the West Bank translates into only 86 percent from the Palestinian perspective),[156] including Arab parts of East Jerusalem and the entire Gaza Strip,[157][158] as well as a stipulation that 69 Jewish settlements (which comprise 85% of the West Bank's Jewish settlers) would be ceded to Israel, no right of return to Israel, no sovereignty over the Temple Mount or any core East Jerusalem neighbourhoods, and continued Israel control over the Jordan Valley.[159][160]

Arafat rejected this offer,[157] which Palestinian negotiators, Israeli analysts and Israeli Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami described as ""unacceptable"".[151][161] According to the Palestinian negotiators the offer did not remove many of the elements of the Israeli occupation regarding land, security, settlements, and Jerusalem.[162]

After the Camp David summit, a narrative emerged, supported by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and his foreign minister Shlomo Ben-Ami, as well as US officials including Dennis Ross and Madeleine Albright, that Yasser Arafat had rejected a generous peace offer from Israel and instead incited a violent uprising. This narrative suggested that Arafat was not interested in a two-state solution, but rather aimed to destroy Israel and take over all of Palestine. This view was widely accepted in US and Israeli public opinion. Nearly all scholars and most Israeli and US officials involved in the negotiations have rejected this narrative. These individuals include prominent Israeli negotiators, the IDF chief of staff, the head of the IDF's intelligence bureau, the head of the Shin Bet as well as their advisors.[163]

No tenable solution was crafted which would satisfy both Israeli and Palestinian demands, even under intense US pressure. Clinton has long blamed Arafat for the collapse of the summit.[164] In the months following the summit, Clinton appointed former US Senator George J. Mitchell to lead a fact-finding committee aiming to identify strategies for restoring the peace process. The committee's findings were published in 2001 with the dismantlement of existing Israeli settlements and Palestinian crackdown on militant activity being one strategy.[165]

Developments following Camp David

Following the failed summit Palestinian and Israeli negotiators continued to meet in small groups through August and September 2000 to try to bridge the gaps between their respective positions. The United States prepared its own plan to resolve the outstanding issues. Clinton's presentation of the US proposals was delayed by the advent of the Second Intifada at the end of September.[162]

Clinton's plan, eventually presented on 23 December 2000, proposed the establishment of a sovereign Palestinian state in the Gaza Strip and 94–96 percent of the West Bank plus the equivalent of 1–3 percent of the West Bank in land swaps from pre-1967 Israel. On Jerusalem, the plan stated that ""the general principle is that Arab areas are Palestinian and that Jewish areas are Israeli."" The holy sites were to be split on the basis that Palestinians would have sovereignty over the Temple Mount/Noble sanctuary, while the Israelis would have sovereignty over the Western Wall. On refugees the plan suggested a number of proposals including financial compensation, the right of return to the Palestinian state, and Israeli acknowledgment of suffering caused to the Palestinians in 1948. Security proposals referred to a ""non-militarized"" Palestinian state, and an international force for border security. Both sides accepted Clinton's plan[162][166][167] and it became the basis for the negotiations at the Taba Peace summit the following January.[162]

Taba Summit (2001)

The Israeli negotiation team presented a new map at the Taba Summit in Taba, Egypt, in January 2001. The proposition removed the ""temporarily Israeli controlled"" areas, and the Palestinian side accepted this as a basis for further negotiation. With Israeli elections looming the talks ended without an agreement but the two sides issued a joint statement attesting to the progress they had made: ""The sides declare that they have never been closer to reaching an agreement and it is thus our shared belief that the remaining gaps could be bridged with the resumption of negotiations following the Israeli elections."" The following month the Likud party candidate Ariel Sharon defeated Ehud Barak in the Israeli elections and was elected as Israeli prime minister on 7 February 2001. Sharon's new government chose not to resume the high-level talks.[162]

Road map for peace (2002–2003)

One peace proposal, presented by the Quartet of the European Union, Russia, the United Nations and the United States on 17 September 2002, was the Road Map for Peace. This plan did not attempt to resolve difficult questions such as the fate of Jerusalem or Israeli settlements, but left that to be negotiated in later phases of the process. The proposal never made it beyond the first phase, whose goals called for a halt to both Israeli settlement construction and Israeli–Palestinian violence. Neither goal has been achieved as of November 2015.[168][169][170]

The Annapolis Conference was a Middle East peace conference held on 27 November 2007, at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, United States. The conference aimed to revive the Israeli–Palestinian peace process and implement the ""Roadmap for peace"".[171] The conference ended with the issuing of a joint statement from all parties. After the Annapolis Conference, the negotiations were continued. Both Mahmoud Abbas and Ehud Olmert presented each other with competing peace proposals. Ultimately no agreement was reached.[172][173]

Arab Peace Initiative (2002, 2007, 2017)

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry meets with an Arab Peace Initiative delegation in Paris, 2013.

The Arab Peace Initiative (Arabic: مبادرة السلام العربية Mubādirat as-Salām al-ʿArabīyyah), also known as the Saudi Initiative, was first proposed by Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia at the 2002 Beirut summit. The initiative is a proposed solution to the Arab–Israeli conflict as a whole, and the Israeli–Palestinian conflict in particular.[174] The initiative was initially published on 28 March 2002, at the Beirut summit, and agreed upon again at the 2007 Riyadh summit. Unlike the Road Map for Peace, it spelled out ""final solution"" borders based on the UN borders established before the 1967 Six-Day War. It offered full normalization of relations with Israel, in exchange for the withdrawal of its forces from all the occupied territories, including the Golan Heights, to recognize ""an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital"" in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, as well as a ""just solution"" for the Palestinian refugees.[175]

The Palestinian Authority led by Yasser Arafat immediately embraced the initiative.[176] His successor Mahmoud Abbas also supported the plan and officially asked U.S. President Barack Obama to adopt it as part of his Middle East policy.[177] Islamist political party Hamas, the elected government of the Gaza Strip, was deeply divided,[178] with most factions rejecting the plan.[179] Palestinians have criticised the Israel–United Arab Emirates normalization agreement and another with Bahrain signed in September 2020, fearing the moves weaken the Arab Peace Initiative, regarding the UAE's move as ""a betrayal.""[180]

The Israeli government under Ariel Sharon rejected the initiative as a ""non-starter""[181] because it required Israel to withdraw to pre-June 1967 borders.[182] After the renewed Arab League endorsement in 2007, then-Prime Minister Ehud Olmert gave a cautious welcome to the plan.[183] In 2015, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed tentative support for the Initiative,[184] but in 2018, he rejected it as a basis for future negotiations with the Palestinians.[185]

Current status

Apartheid

In July 2024, the International Court of Justice determined that Israeli policies violate the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.[186] As of 2022, all the major Israeli and international human rights organizations were in agreement that Israeli actions constituted the crime of apartheid.[187] In April 2021, Human Rights Watch released its report A Threshold Crossed, describing the policies of Israel towards Palestinians living in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza constituted the crime of apartheid.[188] A further report titled Israel's Apartheid Against Palestinians: Cruel System of Domination and Crime Against Humanity was released by Amnesty International on 1 February 2022.[189]

In 2018, the Knesset passed the Nation-State law which the Israeli legal group Adalah nicknamed the ""Apartheid law."" Adalah described the Nation-State law as ""constitutionally enshrining Jewish supremacy and the identity of the State of Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people."" The Nation-State law is a Basic Law, meaning that it has ""quasi-constitutional status,""[190] and states that the right to exercise national self-determination in Israel is ""unique to the Jewish people"".[191]

Occupied Palestinian territory

Protest against land confiscation held at Bil'in, 2011

Israel has occupied the Palestinian territories, which comprise the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) and the Gaza Strip, since the 1967 Six-Day War, making it the longest military occupation in modern history.[192] In 2024, the International Court of Justice determined that the Palestinian territories constitute one political unit and that Israel's occupation since 1967, and the subsequent creation of Israeli settlements and exploitation of natural resources, are illegal under international law. The court also ruled that Israel should pay full reparations to the Palestinian people for the damage the occupation has caused.[193][194]

Some Palestinians say they are entitled to all of the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem. Israel says it is justified in not ceding all this land, because of security concerns, and also because the lack of any valid diplomatic agreement at the time means that ownership and boundaries of this land is open for discussion.[195] Palestinians claim any reduction of this claim is a severe deprivation of their rights. In negotiations, they claim that any moves to reduce the boundaries of this land is a hostile move against their key interests. Israel considers this land to be in dispute and feels the purpose of negotiations is to define what the final borders will be. In 2017 Hamas announced that it was ready to support a Palestinian state on the 1967 borders ""without recognising Israel or ceding any rights"".[196]

Israeli settlements

Israeli settlers in Hebron, West Bank

The international community considers Israeli settlements to be illegal under international law,[197][198][199][200] but Israel disputes this.[201][202][203][204] Those who justify the legality of the settlements use arguments based upon Articles 2 and 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, as well as UN Security Council Resolution 242.[205][better source needed] The expansion of settlements often involves the confiscation of Palestinian land and resources, leading to displacement of Palestinian communities and creating a source of tension and conflict. Settlements are often protected by the Israeli military and are frequently flashpoints for violence against Palestinians. Furthermore, the presence of settlements and Jewish-only bypass roads creates a fragmented Palestinian territory, seriously hindering economic development and freedom of movement for Palestinians.[206] Amnesty International reports that Israeli settlements divert resources needed by Palestinian towns, such as arable land, water, and other resources; and, that settlements reduce Palestinians' ability to travel freely via local roads, owing to security considerations.[206]

As of 2023, there were about 500,000 Israeli settlers living in the West Bank, with another 200,000 living in East Jerusalem.[207][208][209] In February 2023, Israel's Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich took charge of most of the Civil Administration, obtaining broad authority over civilian issues in the West Bank.[210][211] In the first six months of 2023, 13,000 housing units were built in settlements, which is almost three times more than in the whole of 2022.[212]

In a report published in February 2014 covering incidents over the three-year period of 2011–2013, Amnesty International stated that Israeli forces employed reckless violence in the West Bank, and in some instances appeared to engage in wilful killings which would be tantamount to war crimes. Besides the numerous fatalities, Amnesty said at least 261 Palestinians, including 67 children, had been gravely injured by Israeli use of live ammunition. In this same period, 45 Palestinians, including 6 children had been killed. Amnesty's review of 25 civilians deaths concluded that in no case was there evidence of the Palestinians posing an imminent threat. At the same time, over 8,000 Palestinians suffered serious injuries from other means, including rubber-coated metal bullets. Only one IDF soldier was convicted, killing a Palestinian attempting to enter Israel illegally. The soldier was demoted and given a 1-year sentence with a five-month suspension. The IDF answered the charges stating that its army held itself ""to the highest of professional standards"", adding that when there was suspicion of wrongdoing, it investigated and took action ""where appropriate"".[213][214]

Separation of the Gaza Strip

Since 2006, Israel has enforced an official and explicit policy of enforcing ""separation"" between the West Bank and Gaza Strip.[215] This separation policy has involved strict restrictions on imports, exports and travel to and from the Gaza Strip.[216] This policy began to develop as early as the 1950s, but was further formalized with the implementation of an Israeli closure regime in 1991, where Israel began requiring Gazans to obtain permits to exit the Gaza Strip and to enter the West Bank (cancelling the ""general exit permit""). By treating the Gaza Strip as a separate entity, Israel has aimed to increase its control over the West Bank while avoiding a political resolution to the conflict.[217][218] The lack of territorial contiguity between Gaza and the West Bank and the absence of any ""safe passage"" explain the success of Israel's policy of separation.[219] Harvard political economist Sara Roy describes the separation policy as motivated by Israeli rejection of territorial compromise, fundamentally undermining Palestinian political and economic cohesion and weakening national unity among Palestinians.[220][221]

The severing of Gaza from the West Bank hinterland reflects a paradigm shift in the framing of the conflict. After Hamas assumed power in 2007, Israel declared Gaza a ""hostile territory,"" preferring to frame its obligations towards Gaza in terms of the law of armed conflict, over what it presented as a border dispute, as opposed to those of military occupation[219][222] (this framing was rebuffed by the ICJ in 2024 when the court stated that Israel continued to occupy the Gaza Strip even after the 2005 disengagement).[223] Indeed, the intensified blockade policy was presented by Israeli officials as ""economic warfare"" intended to ""keep the Gazan economy on the brink of collapse"" at the ""lowest possible level.""[219] Roy cites an Israeli Supreme Court's decision approving fuel cuts to Gaza as emblematic of the disabling of Gaza; the court deemed the fuel cuts permissible on the basis that they would not harm the population's ""essential humanitarian needs.""

The executive director of the Israeli human rights organization Gisha described Israeli policy towards Gaza between 2007 and 2010 as ""explicitly punitive,"" controlling the entry of food based on calculated calorie needs to limit economic activity and enforce ""economic warfare."" These restrictions included allowing only small packets of margarine to prevent local food production. Gaza's GDP dramatically declined during this period as a result of these measures.[224] Indeed, by April 2010 Israel restricted the entry of commercial items to Gaza to a list of 73 products, compared with 4,000 products which had previously been approved. The result was the virtual collapse of Gaza's private sector, which Roy describes as largely completed after the 2008 Israeli Operation Cast Lead in Gaza.[220] According to Gisha, travel restrictions from the Gaza Strip are not based on individual security concerns, rather, the general rule is that travel to Israel or the West Bank from Gaza is not permitted other than in ""exceptional"" cases.[225] Israeli imposed travel restrictions aim in particular to prevent Gazans from living in the West Bank. Indeed, Israeli policy treats the Gaza Strip as a ""terminus"" station, with family reunification between the West Bank and Gaza Strip only possible if the family agrees to permanently relocate to the Gaza Strip.[226] The Israeli officials described the blockade as serving limited security value, instead referring to these restrictions as motivated by ""political-security.""[227]

Blockade of the Gaza Strip

Israel's attack on Gaza in 2009

Although closure has a long history in Gaza dating back to 1991 when it was first imposed, it was made more acute after 2000 with the start of the second intifada. Closure was tightened further after the 2005 disengagement and then again in 2006, after Hamas's electoral victory.[221] Heightened restrictions were imposed on imports and exports as well as on the movement of people, including Gaza's labor force. The total siege of Gaza that was imposed following the Hamas led attack on Israel during 7 October 2023, was part of that same policy of separation and closure, characterized by the destruction of Gaza's infrastructure (especially housing) and the denial of food, water, electricity, and fuel to its population.[219] On 9 October 2023, Israel declared war on Hamas and tightened its blockade of the Gaza Strip.[228] Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant declared, ""There will be no electricity, no food, no fuel, everything is closed. We are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly.""[229][230]

Since its initiation, blockade has had a detrimental impact on the private sector in Gaza, the primary driver of economic growth in Gaza. Prior to the blockade, Gaza imported 95% of its inputs for manufacturing and exported 85% of the finished products (primarily to Israel and the West Bank). Employment in this sector dropped to 4% by 2010, with an overall unemployment rate of 40% at this time and 80% of the population living on less than 2 dollars a day.[231] Fewer than 40 commercial items were allowed in to the Gaza Strip by 2009, compared to a list of 4,000 items before the start of the blockade. Fuel imports were restricted such that 95% of Gaza's industrial operations were forced to close, with the rest operating far below capacity. In aggregate, 100,000 out of the 120,000 employed in the private sector lost their jobs as a result of the blockade. Most critically for the economy has been the near complete ban on exports from the Gaza Strip. The number of truckloads carrying exports fell to 2% their pre-blockade numbers. Only exports to the European market were allowed, a far less profitable market for Gazans than Israel and the West Bank. The products approved for export were primarily flowers and strawberries. The first export to the West Bank or Israel did not happen until 2012 and only in very limited quantities: up to four truckloads of furniture manufactured in Gaza were allowed through Israel for an exhibition in Amman.[221]

Even in the early years of Israeli imposed closure, the associated increased cost of doing business had a detrimental impact on trade. Goods transferred between the West Bank, Gaza, and Israel were required to be loaded onto Palestinian trucks initially and then off loaded onto Israeli trucks at the border even for distances of 50–100 miles. These increased costs include the costs for security checks, clearance, storage, and spoilage, as well as increased transportation costs.[232]

The Military Advocate General of Israel said that Israel is justified under international law to impose a blockade on an enemy for security reasons as Hamas ""turned the territory under its de facto control into a launching pad of mortar and rocket attacks against Israeli towns and villages in southern Israel.""[233] Media headlines have described a United Nations commission as ruling that Israel's blockade is ""both legal and appropriate.""[234][235] However, Amnesty International has stated that this is ""completely false,"" and that the cited UN report made no such claim.[236] The Israeli Government's continued land, sea and air blockage is tantamount to collective punishment of the population, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.[237]

In January 2008, the Israeli government calculated how many calories per person were needed to prevent a humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip, and then subtracted eight percent to adjust for the ""culture and experience"" of the Gazans. Details of the calculations were released following Israeli human rights organization Gisha's application to the high court. Israel's Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories, who drafted the plan, stated that the scheme was never formally adopted, this was not accepted by Gisha.[238][239][240]

On 20 June 2010, in response to the Gaza flotilla raid, Israel's Security Cabinet approved a new system governing the blockade that would allow practically all non-military or dual-use items to enter the Gaza Strip. According to a cabinet statement, Israel would ""expand the transfer of construction materials designated for projects that have been approved by the Palestinian Authority, including schools, health institutions, water, sanitation and more—as well as (projects) that are under international supervision.""[241] Despite the easing of the land blockade, Israel will continue to inspect all goods bound for Gaza by sea at the port of Ashdod.[242] Despite these announcements, the economic situation did not substantially change and the virtual complete ban on exports remained in place. Only some consumer products and material for donor-sponsored projects was allowed in.[243]

United Nations and recognition of Palestinian statehood

State of Palestine Countries that have recognised the State of Palestine Countries that have not recognised the State of Palestine

The PLO have campaigned for full member status for the state of Palestine at the UN and for recognition on the 1967 borders. This campaign has received widespread support.[244][245] The UN General Assembly votes every year almost unanimously in favor of a resolution calling for the establishment of a Palestinian state on the 1967 borders.[246] The US and Israel instead prefer to pursue bilateral negotiation rather than resolving the conflict on the basis of international law.[247][248] Netanyahu has criticized the Palestinians of purportedly trying to bypass direct talks,[249] whereas Abbas has argued that the continued construction of Israeli-Jewish settlements is ""undermining the realistic potential"" for the two-state solution.[250] Although Palestine has been denied full member status by the UN Security Council,[251] in late 2012 the UN General Assembly overwhelmingly approved the de facto recognition of sovereign Palestine by granting non-member state status.[252]

Incitement

Following the Oslo Accords, which was to set up regulative bodies to rein in frictions, Palestinian incitement against Israel, Jews, and Zionism continued, parallel with Israel's pursuance of settlements in the Palestinian territories,[253] though under Abu Mazen it has reportedly dwindled significantly.[254] Charges of incitement have been reciprocal,[255][256] both sides interpreting media statements in the Palestinian and Israeli press as constituting incitement.[254] Schoolbooks published for both Israeli and Palestinian schools have been found to have encouraged a one-sided narrative and at times hatred of the other side.[257][258][259][260][261][262] Perpetrators of murderous attacks, whether against Israelis or Palestinians, often find strong vocal support from sections of their communities despite varying levels of condemnation from politicians.[263][264][265]

Both parties to the conflict have been criticized by third-parties for teaching incitement to their children by downplaying the other side's historical ties to the area, teaching propagandist maps, or indoctrinating their children to one day join the armed forces.[266][267]

Issues in dispute

The core issues of the conflict are borders, the status of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, the status of Jerusalem, the right of return for Palestinian refugees, and security.[136][140][268][269] With the PLO's recognition of Israel's ""right to exist"" in 1982,[150] the international community with the main exception of the United States and Israel[270][271] has been in consensus on a framework for resolving the conflict on the basis of international law.[272] Various UN bodies and the ICJ have supported this position;[272][136] every year, the UN General Assembly votes almost unanimously in favor of a resolution titled ""Peaceful Settlement of the Question of Palestine."" This resolution consistently affirms the illegality of the Israeli settlements, the annexation of East Jerusalem, and the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war. It also emphasizes the need for an Israeli withdrawal from the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967 and the need for a just resolution to the refugee question on the basis of UN resolution 194.[246]

Unilateral strategies and the rhetoric of hardline political factions, coupled with violence, have fostered mutual embitterment and hostility and a loss of faith in the possibility of reaching a peaceful settlement. Since the break down of negotiations, security has played a less important role in Israeli concerns, trailing behind employment, corruption, housing and other pressing issues.[273] Israeli policy had reoriented to focus on managing the conflict and the associated occupation of Palestinian territory, rather than reaching a negotiated solution.[273][274][141][275][276] The expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank has led the majority of Palestinians to believe that Israel is not committed to reaching an agreement, but rather to a pursuit of establishing permanent control over this territory in order to provide that security.[277]

Status of Jerusalem

Greater Jerusalem, May 2006. CIA remote sensing map showing what the CIA regards as settlements, plus refugee camps, fences, and walls

In 1967, Israel unilaterally annexed East Jerusalem, in violation of international law. Israel seized a significant area further east of the city, eventually creating a barrier of Israeli settlements around the city, isolating Jerusalem's Palestinian population from the West Bank.[278] Israel's policy of constructing sprawling Jewish neighborhoods surrounding the Palestinian sections of the city were aimed at making a repartition of the city almost impossible. In a further effort to change the demography of Jerusalem in favor of a Jewish majority, Israel discouraged Palestinian presence in the city while encouraging Jewish presence, as a matter of policy. Specifically, Israel introduced policies restricting the space available for the construction of Palestinian neighborhoods, delaying or denying building permits and raising housing demolition orders.[279] Tensions in Jerusalem are primarily driven by provocations by Israeli authorities and Jewish extremists against Arabs in the city.[280]

The Israeli government, including the Knesset and Supreme Court, is located in the ""new city"" of West Jerusalem and has been since Israel's founding in 1948. After Israel annexed East Jerusalem in 1967, it assumed complete administrative control of East Jerusalem. Since then, various UN bodies have consistently denounced Israel's control over East Jerusalem as invalid.[279] In 1980, Israel passed the Jerusalem Law declaring ""Jerusalem, complete and united, is the capital of Israel.""[281][better source needed]

Many countries do not recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, with exceptions being the United States,[282] and Russia.[283] The majority of UN member states and most international organisations do not recognise Israel's claims to East Jerusalem which occurred after the 1967 Six-Day War, nor its 1980 Jerusalem Law proclamation.[284] The International Court of Justice in its 2004 Advisory opinion on the ""Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory"" described East Jerusalem as ""occupied Palestinian territory"".[285]

The three largest Abrahamic religions—Judaism, Christianity, and Islam—hold Jerusalem as an important setting for their religious and historical narratives. Jerusalem is the holiest city in Judaism, being the former location of the Jewish temples on the Temple Mount and the capital of the ancient Israelite kingdom. For Muslims, Jerusalem is the third holiest site, being the location of the Isra' and Mi'raj event, and the Al-Aqsa Mosque. For Christians, Jerusalem is the site of Jesus' crucifixion and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.

Holy sites and the Temple Mount

Since the early 20th century, the issue of holy places and particularly the sacred places in Jerusalem has been employed by nationalist politicians.[286]

Israelis did not have access to the holy places in East Jerusalem during the period of Jordanian rule.[287] Since 1975, Israel has banned Muslims from worshiping at Joseph's Tomb, a shrine considered sacred by both Jews and Muslims. Settlers established a yeshiva, installed a Torah scroll and covered the mihrab. During the Second Intifada Palestinian protesters looted and burned the site.[288][289] Israeli security agencies routinely monitor and arrest Jewish extremists that plan attacks, though many serious incidents have still occurred.[290] Israel has allowed almost complete autonomy to the Muslim trust (Waqf) over the Temple Mount.[279]

Palestinians have voiced concerns regarding the welfare of Christian and Muslim holy places under Israeli control.[291] Additionally, some Palestinian advocates have made statements alleging that the Western Wall Tunnel was re-opened with the intent of causing the mosque's collapse.[292]

Palestinian refugees

Palestinian refugees, 1948

Palestinian refugees are people who lost both their homes and means of livelihood as a result of the 1948 Arab–Israeli conflict[293] and the 1967 Six-Day War.[294] The number of Palestinians who were expelled or fled from Israel was estimated at 711,000 in 1949.[295] The descendants of all refugees (not just Palestinian refugees)[296] are considered by the UN to also be refugees. As of 2010 there are 4.7 million Palestinian refugees.[297] Between 350,000 and 400,000 Palestinians were displaced during the 1967 Arab–Israeli war.[294] A third of the refugees live in recognized refugee camps in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The remainder live in and around the cities and towns of these host countries.[293] Most Palestinian refugees were born outside Israel and are not allowed to live in any part of historic Palestine.[293][298]

Israel has since 1948 prevented the return of Palestinian refugees and refused any settlement permitting their return except in limited cases.[150][299][300] On the basis of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and UN General Assembly Resolution 194, Palestinians claim the right of refugees to return to the lands, homes and villages where they lived before being driven into exile in 1948 and 1967. Arafat himself repeatedly assured his American and Israeli interlocutors at Camp David that he primarily sought the principle of the right of return to be accepted, rather than the full right of return, in practice.[301]

Palestinian and international authors have justified the right of return of the Palestinian refugees on several grounds:[302][303][304] Several scholars included in the broader New Historians argue that the Palestinian refugees fled or were chased out or expelled by the actions of the Haganah, Lehi and Irgun, Zionist paramilitary groups.[305][306] A number have also characterized this as an ethnic cleansing.[307][308][309][310] The New Historians cite indications of Arab leaders' desire for the Palestinian Arab population to stay put.[311]

The Israeli Law of Return that grants citizenship to people of Jewish descent has been described as discriminatory against other ethnic groups, especially Palestinians that cannot apply for such citizenship under the law of return, to the territory which they were expelled from or fled during the course of the 1948 war.[312][313][314]

According to the UN Resolution 194, adopted in 1948, ""the refugees wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbours should be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable date, and that compensation should be paid for the property of those choosing not to return and for loss of or damage to property which, under principles of international law or in equity, should be made good by the Governments or authorities responsible.""[315] UN Resolution 3236 ""reaffirms also the inalienable right of the Palestinians to return to their homes and property from which they have been displaced and uprooted, and calls for their return"".[316] Resolution 242 from the UN affirms the necessity for ""achieving a just settlement of the refugee problem""; however, Resolution 242 does not specify that the ""just settlement"" must or should be in the form of a literal Palestinian right of return.[317]

Historically, there has been debate over the relative impact of the causes of the 1948 Palestinian exodus, although there is a wide consensus that violent expulsions by Zionist and Israeli forces were the main factor. Other factors include psychological warfare and Arab sense of vulnerability. Notably, historian Benny Morris states that most of Palestine's 700,000 refugees fled because of the ""flail of war"" and expected to return home shortly after a successful Arab invasion. He documents instances in which Arab leaders advised the evacuation of entire communities as happened in Haifa although recognizes that these were isolated events.[318][319] In his later work, Morris considers the displacement the result of a national conflict initiated by the Arabs themselves.[319] In a 2004 interview with Haaretz, he described the exodus as largely resulting from an atmosphere of transfer that was promoted by Ben-Gurion and understood by the military leadership. He also claimed that there ""are circumstances in history that justify ethnic cleansing"".[320] He has been criticized by political scientist Norman Finkelstein for having seemingly changed his views for political, rather than historical, reasons.[321]

Although Israel accepts the right of the Palestinian Diaspora to return into a new Palestinian state, Israel insists that the return of this population into the current state of Israel would threaten the stability of the Jewish state; an influx of Palestinian refugees would lead to the end of the state of Israel as a Jewish state since a demographic majority of Jews would not be maintained.[322][323][324]

Israeli security concerns

Throughout the conflict, Palestinian violence has been a concern for Israelis. Security concerns have historically been a key driver in Israeli political decision making, often expanding in scope and taking precedence over other considerations such as international law and Palestinian human rights.[325][326][327] The occupation of the West Bank, Gaza, East Jerusalem and the continued expansion of settlements in those areas have been justified on security grounds.[328]

Israel,[329] along with the United States[330][better source needed] and the European Union, refer to any use of force by Palestinian groups as terroristic and criminal.[331][332][page needed] The United Nations General Assembly resolution A/RES/45/130 reflects an international consensus (113 out of 159 voting nations voted in favor, 13 voted against[333]) affirming Palestinians' legitimacy, as a people under foreign occupation, to use armed struggle to resist said occupation.[334]

In Israel, Palestinian suicide bombers have targeted civilian buses, restaurants, shopping malls, hotels and marketplaces.[335] From 1993 to 2003, 303 Palestinian suicide bombers attacked Israel.[citation needed] In 1994, Hamas initiated their first lethal suicide attack in response to the cave of the Patriarchs massacre where American-Israeli physician Baruch Goldstein opened fire in a mosque, killing 29 people and injuring 125.[336]

The Israeli government initiated the construction of a security barrier following scores of suicide bombings and terrorist attacks in July 2003. Israel's coalition government approved the security barrier in the northern part of the green line between Israel and the West Bank. According to the IDF, since the erection of the fence, terrorist acts have declined by approximately 90%.[337] The decline in attacks can also be attributed to the permanent presence of Israeli troops inside and around Palestinian cities and increasing security cooperation between the IDF and the Palestinian Authority during this period.[338] The barrier followed a route that ran almost entirely through land occupied by Israel in June 1967, unilaterally seizing more than 10% of the West Bank, including whole neighborhoods and settlement blocs, while splitting Palestinian villages in half with immediate effects on Palestinian's freedom of movement. The barrier, in some areas, isolated farmers from their fields and children from their schools, while also restricting Palestinians from moving within the West Bank or pursuing employment in Israel.[339][page needed][340][341]

In 2004 the International Court of Justice ruled that the construction of the barrier violated the Palestinian right to self-determination, contravened the Fourth Geneva Convention, and could not be justified as a measure of Israeli self-defense.[342] The ICJ further expressed that the construction of the wall by Israel could become a permanent fixture, altering the status quo. Israel's High Court, however, disagreed with the ICJ's conclusions, stating that they lacked a factual basis. Several human rights organizations, including B'Tselem, Human Rights Watch, and Amnesty International, echoed the ICJ's concerns. They suggested that the wall's route was designed to perpetuate the existence of settlements and facilitate their future annexation into Israel, and that the wall was a means for Israel to consolidate control over land used for illegal settlements. The sophisticated structure of the wall also indicated its likely permanence.[343]

Since 2001, the threat of Qassam rockets fired from Palestinian territories into Israel continues to be of great concern for Israeli defense officials.[344] In 2006—the year following Israel's disengagement from the Gaza Strip—the Israeli government claimed to have recorded 1,726 such launches, more than four times the total rockets fired in 2005.[329][345] As of January 2009, over 8,600 rockets have been launched,[346][347] causing widespread psychological trauma and disruption of daily life.[348] As a result of these attacks, Israelis living in southern Israel have had to spend long periods in bomb shelters. The relatively small payload carried on these rockets, Israel's advanced early warning system, American-supplied anti-missile capabilities, and network of shelters made the rockets rarely lethal. In 2014, out of 4,000 rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, only six Israeli civilians were killed. For comparison, the payload carried on these rockets is smaller than Israeli tank shells, of which 49,000 were fired in Gaza in 2014.[349]

There is significant debate within Israel about how to deal with the country's security concerns. Options have included military action (including targeted killings and house demolitions of terrorist operatives), diplomacy, unilateral gestures toward peace, and increased security measures such as checkpoints, roadblocks and security barriers. The legality and the wisdom of all of the above tactics have been called into question by various commentators.[citation needed]

Since mid-June 2007, Israel's primary means of dealing with security concerns in the West Bank has been to cooperate with and permit United States-sponsored training, equipping, and funding of the Palestinian Authority's security forces, which with Israeli help have largely succeeded in quelling West Bank supporters of Hamas.[350]

Water resources

In the Middle East, water resources are of great political concern. Since Israel receives much of its water from two large underground aquifers which continue under the Green Line, the use of this water has been contentious in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Israel withdraws most water from these areas, but it also supplies the West Bank with approximately 40 million cubic metres annually, contributing to 77% of Palestinians' water supply in the West Bank, which is to be shared for a population of about 2.6 million.[351]

Palestinian villagers purchase water from water trucks in Khirbet A-Duqaiqah in the Hebron Hills.

While Israel's consumption of this water has decreased since it began its occupation of the West Bank, it still consumes the majority of it: in the 1950s, Israel consumed 95% of the water output of the Western Aquifer, and 82% of that produced by the Northeastern Aquifer. Although this water was drawn entirely on Israel's own side of the pre-1967 border, the sources of the water are nevertheless from the shared groundwater basins located under both West Bank and Israel.[352]

In the Oslo II Accord, both sides agreed to maintain ""existing quantities of utilization from the resources."" In so doing, the Palestinian Authority established the legality of Israeli water production in the West Bank, subject to a Joint Water Committee (JWC). Moreover, Israel obligated itself in this agreement to provide water to supplement Palestinian production, and further agreed to allow additional Palestinian drilling in the Eastern Aquifer, also subject to the Joint Water Committee.[353][354] The water that Israel receives comes mainly from the Jordan River system, the Sea of Galilee and two underground sources. According to a 2003 BBC article the Palestinians lack access to the Jordan River system.[355]

According to a report of 2008 by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, water resources were confiscated for the benefit of the Israeli settlements in the Ghor. Palestinian irrigation pumps on the Jordan River were destroyed or confiscated after the 1967 war and Palestinians were not allowed to use water from the Jordan River system. Furthermore, the authorities did not allow any new irrigation wells to be drilled by Palestinian farmers, while it provided fresh water and allowed drilling wells for irrigation purposes at the Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.[356]

A report was released by the UN in August 2012 and Max Gaylard, the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in the occupied Palestinian territory, explained at the launch of the publication: ""Gaza will have half a million more people by 2020 while its economy will grow only slowly. In consequence, the people of Gaza will have an even harder time getting enough drinking water and electricity, or sending their children to school"". Gaylard present alongside Jean Gough, of the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF), and Robert Turner, of the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). The report projects that Gaza's population will increase from 1.6 million people to 2.1 million people in 2020, leading to a density of more than 5,800 people per square kilometre.[357]

Future and financing

Numerous foreign nations and international organizations have established bilateral agreements with the Palestinian and Israeli water authorities. It was estimated that a future investment of about US$1.1bn for the West Bank and $0.8bn for the Gaza Strip Southern Governorates was needed for the planning period from 2003 to 2015.[358]

In late 2012, a donation of $21.6 million was announced by the Government of the Netherlands—the Dutch government stated that the funds would be provided to the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), for the specific benefit of Palestinian children. An article, published by the UN News website, stated that: ""Of the $21.6 million, $5.7 will be allocated to UNRWA's 2012 Emergency Appeal for the occupied Palestinian territory, which will support programmes in the West Bank and Gaza aiming to mitigate the effects on refugees of the deteriorating situation they face.""[357]

Agricultural rights

The conflict has been about land since its inception.[359] When Israel became a state after the war in 1948, 77% of Palestine's land was used for the creation on the state.[360] The majority of those living in Palestine at the time became refugees in other countries and this first land crisis became the root of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.[361][page needed] Because the root of the conflict is with land, the disputes between Israel and Palestine are well-manifested in the agriculture of Palestine.

In Palestine, agriculture is a mainstay in the economy. The production of agricultural goods supports the population's sustenance needs and fuels Palestine's export economy.[362] According to the Council for European Palestinian Relations, the agricultural sector formally employs 13.4% of the population and informally employs 90% of the population.[362] Over the past 10 years[when?], unemployment rates in Palestine have increased and the agricultural sector became the most impoverished sector in Palestine. Unemployment rates peaked in 2008 when they reached 41% in Gaza.[363]

Palestinian agriculture suffers from numerous problems including Israeli military and civilian attacks on farms and farmers, blockades to exportation of produce and importation of necessary inputs, widespread confiscation of land for nature reserves as well as military and settler use, confiscation and destruction of wells, and physical barriers within the West Bank.[364]

Israel's West Bank barrier

The barrier between Israel and Palestine

With the construction of the separation barrier, the Israeli state promised free movement across regions. However, border closures, curfews, and checkpoints has significantly restricted Palestinian movement.[365][366] In 2012, there were 99 fixed check points and 310 flying checkpoints.[367][page needed] The border restrictions impacted the imports and exports in Palestine and weakened the industrial and agricultural sectors because of the constant Israeli control in the West Bank and Gaza.[368] In order for the Palestinian economy to be prosperous, the restrictions on Palestinian land must be removed.[364] According to The Guardian and a report for World Bank, the Palestinian economy lost $3.4bn (%35 of the annual GDP) to Israeli restrictions in the West Bank alone.[369]

Palestinian violence outside of Israel

Some Palestinians have committed violent acts over the globe on the pretext of a struggle against Israel.[370]

During the late 1960s, groups affiliated with the PLO became increasingly infamous for its use of international terror. In 1969 alone, these groups were responsible for hijacking 82 planes. El Al Airlines became a regular hijacking target.[371][372] The hijacking of Air France Flight 139 by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine culminated during a hostage-rescue mission, where Israeli special forces successfully rescued the majority of the hostages.

One of the most well-known and notorious terrorist acts was the capture and eventual murder of 11 Israeli athletes by the Black September Organization during the 1972 Summer Olympics.[373]

Palestinian-on-Palestinian violence

A demonstration in support of Fatah in Gaza City in January 2013

Fighting among rival Palestinian and Arab movements has played a crucial role in shaping Israel's security policy towards Palestinian militants, as well as in the Palestinian leadership's own policies.[citation needed] As early as the 1930s revolts in Palestine, Arab forces fought each other while also skirmishing with Zionist and British forces, and internal conflicts continue to the present day.[citation needed]

In the First Intifada, more than a thousand Palestinians were killed in a campaign initiated by the Palestine Liberation Organization to crack down on suspected Israeli security service informers and collaborators. The Palestinian Authority was strongly criticized for its treatment of alleged collaborators, rights groups complaining that those labeled collaborators were denied fair trials. According to a report released by the Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring Group, less than 45 percent of those killed were actually guilty of informing for Israel.[374][better source needed]

Overriding authority and international status

Area C, controlled by Israel under Oslo Accords, in blue and red, in December 2011

As far as Israel is concerned, the jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority is derived from the Oslo Accords, signed with the PLO, under which it acquired control over cities in the Palestinian territories (Area A) while the surrounding countryside came either under Israeli security and Palestinian civil administration (Area B) or complete Israeli civil administration (Area C). Israel has built additional highways to allow Israelis to traverse the area without entering Palestinian cities in Area A. The initial areas under Palestinian Authority control are diverse and non-contiguous. The areas have changed over time by subsequent negotiations, including Oslo II, Wye River and Sharm el-Sheik. According to Palestinians, the separated areas make it impossible to create a viable nation and fails to address Palestinian security needs; Israel has expressed no agreement to withdrawal from some Areas B, resulting in no reduction in the division of the Palestinian areas, and the institution of a safe pass system, without Israeli checkpoints, between these parts.

Under the Oslo Accords, as a security measure, Israel has insisted on its control over all land, sea and air border crossings into the Palestinian territories, and the right to set import and export controls. This is to enable Israel to control the entry into the territories of materials of military significance and of potentially dangerous persons.

The PLO's objective for international recognition of the State of Palestine is considered by Israel as a provocative ""unilateral"" act that is inconsistent with the Oslo Accords.

Economic disputes and boycotts

In Gaza, the agricultural market suffers from economic boycotts and border closures and restrictions placed by Israel.[375] The PA's Minister of Agriculture estimates that around US$1.2 billion were lost in September 2006 because of these security measures. This embargo was brought on by Hamas' refusal to recognize Israel's right to statehood.[citation needed] As a result, as of 2007 , the PA's 160,000 employees had not received their salaries in over one year.[376]

Fatalities

Studies provide aggregated casualty data for the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, 13,000 Israelis and Palestinians were killed in the conflict between 1948 and 1997.[379] Other estimates give 14,500 killed between 1948 and 2009.[379][380] During the 1982 Lebanon War, Israel killed an estimated 20,000 Palestinians and Lebanese, not including the 800–3,500 Palestinians killed in the Sabra-Shatila Massacre.[9]

According to B'tselem, during the first intifada from 1987 until 2000, 1,551 Palestinians and 421 Israelis lost their lives.[381] According to the database of the UNOffice for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs – occupied Palestinian territory (OCHAoPt), 6,407 Palestinians and 308 Israelis were killed in the conflict from 2008 to September 2023, before the Gaza war.[377][378]

Figures include both Israeli civilians and security forces casualties in West Bank, Gaza and Israel. All numbers refer to casualties of direct conflict between Israelis and Palestinians including in IDF military operations, artillery shelling, search and arrest campaigns, barrier demonstrations, targeted killings, settler violence etc. The figures do not include events indirectly related to the conflict such as casualties from unexploded ordnance, etc., or events when the circumstances remain unclear or are in dispute. The figures include all reported casualties of all ages and both genders.[382]

As reported by the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem, from 29 September 2000 to the year 2010, a total of 7,454 Palestinian and Israeli individuals were killed due to the conflict. According to the report, 1,317 of the 6,371 Palestinians were minors, and at least 2,996 did not participate in fighting at the time of death. Palestinians killed 1,083 Israelis, including 741 civilians, of whom 124 were minors.[383]

On 7 October 2023, Hamas-led militant groups launched a surprise attack on Israel, in which 1,195 Israelis and foreign nationals, including 815 civilians, were killed, and 251 taken hostage.[384] Since the start of Gaza war, over 52,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been reported as killed,[i] over half of them women and children, and more than 110,000 Palestinians have been injured.[385][386][387] A study in the Lancet estimated 64,260 deaths due to traumatic injuries by June 2024, while noting a larger potential death toll when ""indirect"" deaths are included.[388][25] Israel's tightened blockade of Gaza cut off basic necessities, causing a severe hunger crisis with a high risk of famine persisting as of May 2025 .[389][390][391]

Criticism of casualty statistics

The Israeli-based International Policy Institute for Counter-Terrorism (ICT) claimed that Israeli and Palestinian human rights groups overestimated the percentage of civilians killed since the IDF suspected many of those killed to be possible militants.[392][393]

During Operation Cast Lead, Israeli figures reported the number of Palestinians killed at 1,166 Palestinian, 60 percent were classified as ""terrorists"" by Israeli officials. This discrepancy is partially due to Israel's classification of Gazan police, who did not take part in hostilities, as combatants. The broad consensus among human rights organizations is that these police were primarily civilians, as they did not actively participate in hostilities nor were they part of armed groups. The accuracy of Israeli casualty figures was further questioned based on the number of children killed. Israel reported 89 Palestinian minors killed, whereas the human rights organization B'Tselem reported 252, substantiating their figures with birth and death certificates and other documents in almost all cases. The Israeli figures also stand out against the figures published by the US Department of State, which reported the number killed ""at close to 1,400 Palestinians, including more than 1,000 civilians.""[394]

Landmines and unexploded ordnance

A comprehensive collection mechanism to gather land mine and explosive remnants of war (ERW) casualty data does not exist for the Palestinian territories.[395] In 2009, the United Nations Mine Action Centre reported that more than 2,500 mine and explosive remnants of war casualties occurred between 1967 and 1998, at least 794 casualties (127 killed, 654 injured and 13 unknown) occurred between 1999 and 2008 and that 12 people had been killed and 27 injured since the Gaza War.[395] The UN Mine Action Centre identified the main risks as coming from ""ERW left behind by Israeli aerial and artillery weapon systems, or from militant caches targeted by the Israeli forces.""[395] There are at least 15 confirmed minefields in the West Bank on the border with Jordan. The Palestinian National Security Forces do not have maps or records of the minefields.[395]

As Israel's war in Gaza enters a new, violent phase, a growing number of voices within the country are speaking out against it - and how it's being fought. Yair Golan, a left-wing politician and former deputy commander of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), sparked outrage on Monday when he said: ""Israel is on the way to becoming a pariah state, like South Africa was, if we don't return to acting like a sane country. ""A sane state does not wage war against civilians, does not kill babies as a hobby, and does not set itself the goal of depopulating the population,"" he told Israeli public radio's popular morning news programme. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hit back, describing the comments as ""blood libel"". But on Wednesday, a former Israeli minister of defence and IDF chief of staff - Moshe ""Bogi"" Ya'alon - went further. ""This is not a 'hobby',"" he wrote in a post on X, ""but a government policy, whose ultimate goal is to hold on to power. And it is leading us to destruction."" Just 19 months ago, when Hamas gunmen crossed the fence into Israel and killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, taking 251 others back to Gaza as hostages - statements like these seemed almost unthinkable.

But now Gaza is in ruins, Israel has launched a new military offensive, and, though it has also agreed to lift its 11-week blockade on the territory, just a trickle of aid has so far entered. Recent polling by Israel's Channel 12 found that 61% of Israelis want to end the war and see the hostages returned. Just 25% support expanding the fighting and occupying Gaza. The Israeli government insists it will destroy Hamas and rescue the remaining hostages. Netanyahu says he can achieve ""total victory"" - and he maintains a strong core of supporters. But the mood among others in Israeli society ""is one of despair, trauma, and a lack of a sense of ability to change anything"", says former Israeli hostage negotiator Gershon Baskin.

""The overwhelming majority of all the hostage families think that the war has to end, and there has to be an agreement,"" he adds. ""A small minority think that the primary goal of finishing off Hamas is what has to be done, and then the hostages will be freed"".

On Sunday, around 500 protesters, many wearing T-shirts with the inscription ""Stop the horrors in Gaza"" and carrying pictures of babies killed by Israeli air strikes, attempted to march from the town of Sderot to the Gaza border, in protest at Israel's new offensive. They were led by Standing Together - a small but growing anti-war group of Jewish and Palestinian citizens of Israel. After attempting to block a road, the leader of the group Alon-Lee Green was arrested, along with eight others. From house arrest, Mr Green told the BBC: ""I think it's obvious that you can see an awakening within the Israeli public. You can see that more and more people are taking a position."" Another Standing Together activist, Uri Weltmann, said he thinks there's a growing belief that continuing the war is ""not only harmful to the Palestinian civilian population, but also risks the lives of hostages, risks the lives of soldiers, risks the lives of all of us"".

By May 2025, more than 52,000 Gazans had been killed, and more than two-thirds of the buildings in the Gaza Strip were damaged or destroyed.

The next day, Israel declared itself in a state of war for the first time since the Yom Kippur War in 1973. The war began with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) conducting air strikes on the Gaza Strip, followed weeks later by the incursion of ground troops and armored vehicles. A brief ceasefire and a series of hostage exchanges took place in 2025 between late January and early March, but hostilities resumed after negotiations for a second phase of the ceasefire failed to take root. By early May 2025 more than 52,000 Gazans, about 2 percent of the territory’s population, had been killed according to official numbers and more than two-thirds of the buildings in the Gaza Strip had been damaged or destroyed. About 1,700 Israelis had been killed, including those killed in the October 7 attack. Although the agreement led to more than a month of pause in the conflict in the Gaza Strip, its implementation was shaky from the start, and in mid-March the conflict resumed.

Israel-Hamas War , war between Israel and Palestinian militants, especially Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), that began on October 7, 2023, when Hamas launched a land, sea, and air assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip . The October 7 attack resulted in more than 1,200 deaths, primarily Israeli citizens, making it the deadliest day for Israel since its independence. More than 240 people were taken hostage during the attack.

That deal was part of a broader regional transformation. The United States, which had long been the driving force behind the peace process, sought a “pivot to Asia” in its foreign policy and hoped an Israeli-Saudi deal would reduce the resources it needed to devote to the Middle East . Iran , meanwhile, was consolidating an “ axis of resistance ” in the region that included Hezbollah in Lebanon , Pres. Bashar al-Assad in Syria , and Houthi rebels in Yemen . Hamas, whose relationship with Iran had been tumultuous in the 2010s, had grown closer to Iran after 2017 and received significant Iranian support to build up its military capacity and capability.

But while tensions were brewing at home, Saudi Arabia —which had long conditioned diplomatic relations with Israel on the conclusion of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process—had begun negotiating with Israel and the United States on an Israeli-Saudi peace deal . Although Saudi Arabia sought concessions on issues related to the Palestinians, the Palestinians were not directly involved in the discussions and the deal was not expected to satisfy the grievances of the Palestinians in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Many observers believed that disrupting those negotiations was one of the goals of Hamas’s October 7 attack.

In November 2024 the independent Civilian Commission of Inquiry into October 7, which was organized in July 2024 by survivors of the October 7 attack and the families of victims who were either killed or kidnapped, released a report placing broad blame on the Israeli government for effectively bolstering Hamas throughout Netanyahu’s tenure and leaving the IDF ill prepared for the assault. Although the report named Netanyahu, Yoav Gallant , Benny Gantz , the IDF, and intelligence agencies among those responsible for the security failure, it especially condemned Netanyahu for undermining coordination between the political and military echelons.

At the close of 2022, Benjamin Netanyahu returned to office as Israel’s prime minister after cobbling together the most far-right cabinet since Israel’s independence, which proved to be domestically destabilizing. The cabinet pushed for reforms to Israel’s basic laws that would bring the judiciary under legislative oversight; the polarizing move led to unprecedented strikes and protests by many Israelis, including thousands of army reservists, concerned over the separation of powers . In August 2023 senior military officials warned lawmakers that the readiness of the IDF for war had begun to weaken. All the while, provocations by Hezbollah were raising the risk of conflict along Israel’s northern border.

In early 2022 militants from the PIJ and new, localized groups in the West Bank , a territory northeast of the Gaza Strip that is also predominantly inhabited by Palestinians, conducted a string of attacks in Israel. The IDF responded with a series of raids in the West Bank, resulting in the deadliest year for the West Bank since the end of the second Palestinian intifada (uprising; 2000–05). The IDF targeted PIJ militants in the Gaza Strip—but left Hamas alone. In turn, Hamas refrained from escalating the conflict, bolstering the assumption by Israeli officials that they could prioritize other threats over Hamas.

These conflicts were devastating for the Gaza Strip and came at a high human cost for Gaza’s civilians. But they usually lasted only weeks, resulted in few Israeli civilian casualties, and weakened Hamas’s military capacity. Hostilities often resulted in ceasefire agreements that temporarily eased Israel’s blockade and facilitated the transfer of foreign aid into the Gaza Strip, an approach that critics in Israel referred to as “money for quiet.” Many officials in Israel’s defense establishment maintained that Hamas had been effectively deterred by years of conflict and that an occasional flare-up of violence would be manageable. On October 7 the error of that assumption became tragically clear. Ongoing violence in the West Bank, political turmoil at home, and simmering tensions with Hezbollah in Lebanon were among the distractions that left Israel unprepared for the onslaught from the Gaza Strip.

The first major conflict between Israel and Hamas, which included Israeli air strikes and a ground invasion, took place at the end of 2008. Hostilities continued to break out, most notably in 2012, 2014, and 2021. Among the factors complicating those hostilities were the high population density of the Gaza Strip and the proliferation of subterranean tunnels there. Those tunnels were used by Hamas and other Gazans to sidestep the blockade, to conduct operations, and to hide from Israeli forces, and they were difficult to detect or destroy, especially when constructed under urban dwellings.

In 1993 there was a glimmer of hope for a peaceful resolution when the Israeli government and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) reached an agreement on the creation of a Palestinian state alongside an Israeli state (see two-state solution ; Oslo Accords ). Hamas, a militant Palestinian group founded in 1987 and opposed to the more conciliatory stance taken by the PLO, rejected the plan, which included Palestinian recognition of the State of Israel, and carried out a terror campaign in an attempt to disrupt it. The plan was ultimately derailed amid suicide bombings by Hamas and the 1995 assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin by a Jewish extremist. In 2005, in the wake of the collapse of the peace process, Israel unilaterally withdrew from the settlements it had constructed in the Gaza Strip after 1967, and in 2007, after factional conflict within the Palestinian Authority (PA), Hamas emerged as the de facto ruler in the Gaza Strip. The takeover by Hamas prompted a blockade of the Gaza Strip by Israel and Egypt and set the stage for the next decade and a half of continued unrest.

In 1948 the State of Israel was created on land inhabited by both Jews and Arab Palestinians. Hostilities between the two communities that year led to a mass displacement of Palestinians. Many of them became refugees in the Gaza Strip , a narrow swath of land roughly the size of Philadelphia that had come under the control of Egyptian forces in the 1948–49 Arab-Israeli war . The status of the Palestinians remained unresolved as the protracted Arab-Israeli conflict brought recurrent violence to the region, and the fate of the Gaza Strip fell into the hands of Israel when it occupied the territory in the Six-Day War of 1967.

More than 240 others were taken into the Gaza Strip as hostages. Many of them were taken from their homes and some from the music festival. Including Israelis with dual citizenship, more than half of those taken hostage collectively held passports from about two dozen countries, effectively pulling several countries into the efforts to release their citizens.

About 1,200 people were killed in the assault, which included families attacked in their homes in kibbutzim and attendees of an outdoor music festival . That number largely comprised Israeli civilians but also included foreign nationals. A March 2024 United Nations report found evidence that some were victims of sexual violence before they were killed. Adding to the trauma was the fact that it was the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust .

The assault began about 6:30 am with a barrage of at least 2,200 rockets launched into Israel in just 20 minutes. During that opening salvo, Hamas used more than half the total number of rockets launched from Gaza during all of 2021’s 11-day conflict. The barrage reportedly overwhelmed the Iron Dome system, the highly successful antimissile defense system deployed throughout Israel, although the IDF did not specify how many missiles penetrated the system. As the rockets rained down on Israel, at least 1,500 militants from Hamas and the PIJ infiltrated Israel at dozens of points by using explosives and bulldozers to breach the border, which was heavily fortified with smart technology, fencing, and concrete. They disabled communication networks for several of the Israeli military posts nearby, allowing them to attack those installations and enter civilian neighborhoods undetected. Militants simultaneously breached the maritime border by motorboat near the coastal town of Zikim. Others crossed into Israel on motorized paragliders .

On October 7, 2023, Hamas led a stunning coordinated attack , which took place on Shemini Atzeret , a Jewish holiday that closes the autumn thanksgiving festival of Sukkot . Many IDF soldiers were on leave, and the IDF’s attention had been focused on Israel’s northern border rather than on the Gaza Strip in the south.

At war in the Gaza Strip (2023–24)

October 2023: air campaign At 8:23 am on October 7 the IDF announced a state of alert for war and began mobilizing its army reserves (eventually calling up more than 350,000 reservists over the next several days). Two hours later, IDF fighter jets began conducting air strikes in the Gaza Strip. On October 8 Israel declared itself in a state of war, and Netanyahu told residents of the blockaded enclave to “get out now. We will be everywhere and with all our might.” On October 9 Israel ordered a “complete siege” of the Gaza Strip, cutting off water, electricity, food, and fuel from entering the territory. Israel's Iron Dome defense system The Iron Dome antimissile defense system intercepting rockets launched from the Gaza Strip on October 11, 2023. (more) As Israel conducted air strikes, international efforts were made to secure the release of the hostages. Qatar, which in years past had coordinated with Israel on the delivery of international aid packages to the Gaza Strip, became the key mediator, but in the first weeks of the war it managed to negotiate the release of only four of the people held by Hamas. Gaza’s subterranean tunnels—forming an intricate web of passageways extending hundreds of miles—added to the difficulty of locating the hostages as well as targeting militants and their weapons caches: destroying the tunnels without high civilian cost proved difficult, and conducting military activity inside the tunnels presented a high risk for all those inside, especially for the IDF troops and the hostages who might be held there. Just three weeks after Hamas’s assault on October 7, more than 1.4 million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip had become internally displaced, and, with numbers of Palestinians killed still climbing by the thousands, it had already become the deadliest conflict for the Palestinians since the 1948 Arab-Israeli war.

October–November 2023: ground invasion and beginning of the humanitarian crisis Israel-Hamas War Destruction in the Jabalia refugee camp from an Israeli air strike in the Gaza Strip on November 1, 2023. (more) At the end of October Israeli ground forces advanced into the Gaza Strip. Communications in the territory were initially cut, restricting the ability of militants to coordinate but also limiting the ability of paramedics and humanitarian organizations to attend to emergencies. Unlike in previous conflicts, the ground invasion was slow and the number of armored vehicles and personnel was increased gradually. On November 1 the Rafah border crossing between the Gaza Strip and Egypt was opened, under conditions agreed to by Egypt, Hamas, and Israel, to allow a limited number of foreign nationals to evacuate the territory for the first time since October 7. On November 22 Israel’s war cabinet agreed to a prisoner exchange with Hamas, which was mediated by Qatar and Egypt, that would coincide with a temporary pause in fighting. During the pause, which lasted seven days, 110 of the hostages were freed in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners. In the days after fighting resumed, Israeli forces moved into Khan Younis, the largest urban center in the south of the Gaza Strip and the location of the homes of senior Hamas leaders, including Yahya Sinwar and Mohammed Deif. A large number of civilians fled to Rafah, one of the last areas in the enclave for civilians to shelter from the ground invasion, and within weeks more than half of the Gaza Strip’s total population had crammed into the city along Egypt’s border.

December 2023–January 2024: pressure mounts for a ceasefire By year’s end international pressure weighed heavily on Israel amid the high number of civilian casualties and wide destruction in the Gaza Strip. In mid-December U.S. Pres. Joe Biden, during a fundraising event for his reelection campaign, said that Israel was beginning to lose international support. In early January 2024, after nearly 23,000 Palestinians had been reported dead (a number that included mostly civilians but also Hamas fighters), Israel announced a change in strategy that would result in a more targeted approach. By the end of January the average number of daily deaths was one-third of what it had been in October but was still more than three times that of the 2014 conflict, the deadliest in the Gaza Strip until 2023. (By late July, the number of Palestinians reported dead approached 40,000.) In late January a framework emerged through the mediation of Qatar, Egypt, and the United States for a potential three-phase pause in fighting during which a comprehensive agreement to end the war would be negotiated. The pause would include the release, in stages, of hostages held in the Gaza Strip and Palestinian prisoners taken by Israel since the start of the conflict. But the framework remained elusive as Hamas insisted on guarantees that the hostage exchange would lead to a permanent ceasefire.

February–April 2024: invasion of Rafah looms Rafah as refuge in the Israel-Hamas War From November 2023 to May 2024 Rafah provided refuge for the majority of the population of the entire Gaza Strip, who crowded into makeshift shelters in the last urban area to be affected by the Israeli invasion. Image from January 16, 2024. (more) Israeli officials in February announced their intent to extend the war into Rafah, leading to concerns internationally over the high humanitarian cost of such an operation. Netanyahu insisted, however, that an invasion of Rafah would proceed to root out “the last bastion” of Hamas battalions. A rift between Netanyahu and Biden came out into the open as Biden mulled withholding military support if an invasion of Rafah were to go forward without a comprehensive plan in place to protect civilians. In mid-March the IDF said that it would evacuate a portion of the civilians in Rafah to “humanitarian islands” that it would set up in the center of the Gaza Strip. On March 25, for the first time since the outbreak of the war, the United States refrained from vetoing a resolution by the United Nations (UN) Security Council that called for an immediate ceasefire. On April 1 several vehicles carrying aide workers for chef José Andrés’s World Central Kitchen were hit in an Israeli air strike. The seven workers were killed, and the deaths brought increasing scrutiny on the actions of the IDF in the wake of the growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The IDF took responsibility for the deaths with a government spokesman describing the incident as “a terrible chain of errors.” Early that same month, Hamas rejected a ceasefire proposal that would require it to release 40 living hostages who were female, children, older people, or sick in the initial stages, saying it did not have 40 such hostages. At the end of April, as the IDF readied the Gaza Strip for an evacuation of Rafah, Hamas released videos showing proof of life of three hostages.

May–June 2024: Rafah invasion, Operation Arnon, and pressure for a ceasefire Although negotiations seemed to be progressing at the beginning of May, talks broke down on May 5. Hours later, Hamas fired rockets at Israeli soldiers who were stationed near the Kerem Shalom border crossing, the main avenue for humanitarian aid. The attack killed four soldiers and prompted Israel to close the crossing to aid convoys. The next day, Israel ordered the evacuation of 100,000 Palestinians from Rafah. That evening, Hamas accepted a ceasefire proposal tendered by mediators that included efforts toward a “permanent cessation” of hostilities, but Israel reiterated its stance that it would reject any proposal that insists on an end to the war. Meanwhile, Israel’s war cabinet unanimously authorized the military to proceed with its plans for Rafah. Israeli forces began moving to take control of the Rafah border crossing and the Philadelphi Corridor and on May 14 they entered the city. Within days the number of people who had fled Rafah since May 6 exceeded 800,000, and the areas they escaped to were deemed inadequate by international observers. On May 17 a floating pier constructed by the United States for international humanitarian aid received its first shipment, but the distribution of aid was repeatedly disrupted by safety concerns and weather damage. It was operational for a total of only 20 days before use of the pier was abandoned in mid-July. In that time, the total amount of aid delivered through the pier fell slightly short of what is needed to sustain the Gaza Strip’s population for just one day. On June 8 Israeli special forces rescued four of the hostages who had been kidnapped at the music festival in an operation that was conducted in central Gaza. The raid took place in two buildings in the Nuseirat refugee camp in the middle of the day. When the four Israelis were recovered alive and unharmed, the Israeli officers gave word to their commanders by radio: “Ha-yahalomim be-yedeinu” (“The diamonds are on hand”). Heavy fighting took place as the special forces escaped with the rescued hostages, and more than 270 Palestinians in the vicinity were killed as air strikes aimed to shield the Israelis. The officer who led the mission, Arnon Zamora, was critically wounded and died shortly afterward; the operation was renamed Operation Arnon in his honor ex post facto. When the rescued hostages revealed that they knew in captivity that protesters were fighting for their release, demonstrators took to the streets in major cities across Israel that night to celebrate the rescue, call on the government to do more to bring the remaining 120 hostages home, and call for Netanyahu to be replaced as prime minister. The following day Benny Gantz, an opponent of Netanyahu who was also a key figure in his war cabinet, carried out a threat made weeks earlier to resign if Netanyahu had still not articulated a plan for the hostages to be released and end the war. On June 10 the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 2735. It called for an immediate ceasefire, a release of hostages, and the safe distribution of humanitarian aid, followed by a permanent end to hostilities in exchange for the release of remaining hostages and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip. The resolution, which was drafted by the United States and followed a ceasefire plan outlined by Biden weeks earlier, was passed with 14 votes in favor; Russia abstained, saying it had questions about the details of the U.S.-drafted resolution.

July–September 2024: Hamas drops key demand, Israel demands Philadelphi Corridor, poliovirus detected in the Gaza Strip, and Hamas executes six hostages In early July Hamas and Egyptian officials who were involved in the ceasefire negotiations reported that Hamas had dropped its demand for Israel to commit to a permanent end to hostilities. Meanwhile, Netanyahu began insisting that Israel retain control of the Gaza Strip’s Philadelphi Corridor, a demand that Israel had not previously raised in its May 27 proposal. As talks continued, Israel intensified its operations in Gaza. On July 13 an Israeli strike in Khan Younis targeted Mohammed Deif, Hamas’s top military commander. The strike killed Deif, according to an intelligence assessment by the IDF, and about 90 other Palestinians. Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas’s political chief abroad who was leading Hamas’s delegation in ceasefire negotiations, was killed in Tehran on July 31, leaving the negotiations in the hands of the more hard-line and inaccessible Sinwar. On July 23, as Netanyahu arrived in the United States to address the U.S. Congress, Hamas, Fatah (the Palestinian faction that leads the Palestinian Authority), and 12 other Palestinian factions agreed to a reconciliation deal, which was brokered by the Chinese foreign ministry. The agreement would attempt to bring unified governance to the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, which have been split between Fatah and Hamas rule, respectively, since 2007. It was not immediately clear, however, how the “Beijing Declaration” would differ from past failed attempts at reconciliation, such as those in 2011, 2014, and 2017. Meanwhile, the war’s toll on public health was highlighted in July, after The Lancet published a study that indicated a conservative estimate of about four indirect deaths per one direct death during the war due to destroyed health care infrastructure and shortages of food, water, and safe shelter, bringing the total of direct and indirect deaths due to the war to 186,000. Later that month the IDF announced that it had found poliovirus in sewage and would offer vaccines to its soldiers. It also coordinated with international groups to assess the risk of polio among Gazans and administer vaccines. When the first confirmed case of polio was identified in a 10-month-old infant in mid-August, UN agencies requested a pause in fighting to allow health workers to vaccinate children in the Gaza Strip. On August 28 Netanyahu agreed under U.S. pressure to allow a vaccination campaign to take place in select areas. On August 27 Israeli forces rescued Farhan al-Qadi, a Bedouin Arab from Israel who was working as a security guard when he was taken hostage on October 7. He was the first hostage to be rescued from inside a subterranean tunnel and was alone when he was found. Qadi reported that his captors had fled when they learned the IDF was close by. On August 31 Israeli forces found the bodies of six hostages. Autopsies indicated that they were executed 1–2 days before they were found and nearly two months after Hamas had agreed to release three of them in a July ceasefire proposal. Protests erupted in fury across Israel as hundreds of thousands of Israelis took to the streets to demand Netanyahu reach a deal for the hostages to be released. Histadrut, Israel’s largest trade union, joined the protests on September 2 with a general strike (although a court found the strike illegal and ordered it to end that same afternoon). At a press conference that same day, Netanyahu doubled down on his demand to control the Philadelphi Corridor, which he characterized as “the oxygen of Hamas.” In mid-September Israeli forces focused on weakening Hezbollah in Lebanon—including killing its longtime leader, Hassan Nasrallah—while the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip continued to deteriorate from the unbroken bombardment of the territory and from restrictions on the entrance of humanitarian aid.","The Editors Of Encyclopaedia Britannica, Article History",https://cdn.britannica.com/69/100469-050-CF59AEE8/Gaza-strip-political-map-boundary.jpg
Israeli-Palestinian Conflict,Published date not found (newspaper3k),https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/israeli-palestinian-conflict,"Hamas launched its deadly attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, prompting the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to engage in aerial campaigns and ground operations within the Gaza Strip. On January 15, 2025, the United States, Egypt, and Qatar announced that they had mediated a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas to end fifteen months of fighting in Gaza. Hamas released thirty-three of the remaining hostages, while Israel released hundreds of Palestinians from Israeli jails, displaced residents were allowed to return to northern Gaza, and 600 humanitarian aid trucks were permitted to enter the territory each day. However, Israel launched a wave of strikes and ground operations in central and southern Gaza on March 18, bringing an end to the six-week cease-fire.

The conflict has exacerbated regional tensions across the Middle East. The IDF launched a ground invasion of Lebanon following months of cross-border skirmishes with Hezbollah, which began striking northern Israel following Hamas’s October 7 attack. Yemen’s Houthi rebels have shot missiles at Israel and commercial ships in the Red Sea, and other Iran-backed groups have launched dozens of attacks on U.S. military positions in Iraq and Syria. In April and October of 2024, Iran took the unprecedented step of attacking Israel directly, which prompted Israeli counterstrikes targeting Iranian air defenses and missile manufacturing facilities.

Background

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict dates back to the end of the nineteenth century. In 1947, the United Nations adopted Resolution 181, known as the Partition Plan, which sought to divide the British Mandate of Palestine into Arab and Jewish states. On May 14, 1948, the State of Israel was created, sparking the first Arab-Israeli War. The war ended in 1949 with Israel’s victory, but 750,000 Palestinians were displaced, and the territory was divided into 3 parts: the State of Israel, the West Bank (of the Jordan River), and the Gaza Strip.

Over the following years, tensions rose in the region, particularly between Israel and Egypt, Jordan, and Syria. Following the 1956 Suez Crisis and Israel’s invasion of the Sinai Peninsula, Egypt, Jordan, and Syria signed mutual defense pacts in anticipation of a possible mobilization of Israeli troops. In June 1967, following a series of maneuvers by Egyptian President Abdel Gamal Nasser, Israel preemptively attacked Egyptian and Syrian air forces, starting the Six-Day War. After the war, Israel gained territorial control over the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza Strip from Egypt; the West Bank and East Jerusalem from Jordan; and the Golan Heights from Syria.

Six years later, in what is referred to as the Yom Kippur War or the October War, Egypt and Syria launched a surprise two-front attack on Israel to regain their lost territory; the conflict did not result in significant gains for Egypt, Israel, or Syria, but Egyptian President Anwar al-Sadat declared the war a victory for Egypt as it allowed Egypt and Syria to negotiate over previously ceded territory. Finally, in 1979, following a series of cease-fires and peace negotiations, representatives from Egypt and Israel signed the Camp David Accords, a peace treaty that ended the thirty-year conflict between Egypt and Israel.

Even though the Camp David Accords improved relations between Israel and its neighbors, the question of Palestinian self-determination and self-governance remained unresolved. In 1987, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza Strip rose up against the Israeli government in what is known as the first intifada. The 1993 Oslo I Accords mediated the conflict, setting up a framework for the Palestinians to govern themselves in the West Bank and Gaza, and enabled mutual recognition between the newly established Palestinian Authority and Israel’s government. In 1995, the Oslo II Accords expanded on the first agreement, adding provisions that mandated the complete withdrawal of Israel from 6 cities and 450 towns in the West Bank.

In 2000, sparked in part by Palestinian grievances over Israel’s control over the West Bank, a stagnating peace process, and former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon’s visit to the al-Aqsa mosque—the third holiest site in Islam—in September 2000, Palestinians launched the second intifada, which would last until 2005. In response, the Israeli government approved the construction of a barrier wall around the West Bank in 2002, despite opposition from the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court.

Factionalism among the Palestinians flared up when Hamas won the Palestinian Authority’s parliamentary elections in 2006, deposing longtime majority party Fatah. This gave Hamas, a political and militant movement inspired by the Palestinian Muslim Brotherhood, control of the Gaza Strip. Gaza is a small piece of land on the Mediterranean Sea that borders Egypt to the south and has been under the rule of the semi-autonomous Palestinian Authority since 1993. The United States and European Union, among others, did not acknowledge Hamas’ electoral victory, as the group has been considered a terrorist organization by western governments since the late 1990s. Following Hamas’ seizure of control, violence broke out between Hamas and Fatah. Between 2006 and 2011, a series of failed peace talks and deadly confrontations culminated in an agreement to reconcile. Fatah entered into a unity government with Hamas in 2014.

In the summer of 2014, clashes in the Palestinian territories precipitated a military confrontation between the Israeli military and Hamas in which Hamas fired nearly three thousand rockets at Israel, and Israel retaliated with a major offensive in Gaza. The skirmish ended in late August 2014 with a cease-fire deal brokered by Egypt, but only after 73 Israelis and 2,251 Palestinians were killed. After a wave of violence between Israelis and Palestinians in 2015, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas of Fatah announced that Palestinians would no longer be bound by the territorial divisions created by the Oslo Accords.

In March of 2018, Israeli troops killed 183 Palestinians and wounded 6,000 others after some Palestinians stormed the perimeter fence between the Gaza Strip and Israel and threw rocks during an otherwise peaceful demonstration. Just months later, Hamas militants fired over one hundred rockets into Israel, and Israel responded with strikes on more than fifty targets in Gaza during a twenty-four-hour flare-up. The tense political atmosphere resulted in a return to disunity between Fatah and Hamas, with Mahmoud Abbas’ Fatah party controlling the Palestinian Authority from the West Bank and Hamas de facto ruling the Gaza Strip.

The Donald J. Trump administration reversed longstanding U.S. policy by canceling funding for the UN Relief and Works Agency, which provides aid to Palestinian refugees, and relocating the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The Trump administration also helped broker the Abraham Accords, under which Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates normalized relations with Israel, becoming only the third and fourth countries in the region—following Egypt in 1979 and Jordan in 1994—to do so. Similar deals followed with Morocco [PDF] and Sudan. Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas of Fatah rejected the accords, as did Hamas.

In early May 2021, after a court ruled in favor of the eviction of several Palestinian families from East Jerusalem properties, protests erupted, with Israeli police employing force against demonstrators. After several consecutive days of violence, Hamas, the militant group that governs Gaza, and other Palestinian militant groups launched hundreds of rockets into Israeli territory. Israel responded with artillery bombardments and airstrikes, killing more than twenty Palestinians and hitting both military and non-military infrastructure, including residential buildings, media headquarters, and refugee and healthcare facilities. After eleven days, Israel and Hamas agreed to a cease-fire, with both sides claiming victory. The fighting killed more than 250 Palestinians and at least 13 Israelis, wounded nearly 2,000 others, and displaced 72,000 Palestinians.

The most far-right and religious government in Israel’s history, led by Benjamin ‘Bibi’ Netanyahu and his Likud party and comprising two ultra-Orthodox parties and three far-right parties, was inaugurated in late December 2022. The coalition government prioritized the expansion and development of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, endorsed discrimination against LGBTQ+ people on religious grounds, and voted to limit judicial oversight of the government in May 2023 after a delay due to nationwide protests in March.

Recent Developments

In early October 2023, Hamas fighters fired rockets into Israel and stormed southern Israeli cities and towns across the border of the Gaza Strip in a surprise attack, killing more than 1,300 Israelis, injuring 3,300, and taking hundreds of hostages. One day after the October 7 attack, the Israeli cabinet formally declared war against Hamas, followed by a directive from the defense minister to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to carry out a “complete siege” of Gaza. It is the most significant escalation of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in several decades.

Israel ordered over one million Palestinian civilians in northern Gaza to evacuate ahead of a ground invasion that commenced on October 27 in conjunction with Israel’s continued aerial assault. From November 24 to November 30, 2023, a temporary truce facilitated the exchange of certain Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails, as well as a surge in humanitarian aid to the Strip. However, hostilities resumed following reports of violations by both Israeli and Hamas forces.

In January 2024, under pressure from its principal ally, the United States, and amid global scrutiny both over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and doubts about the feasibility of completely eradicating Hamas, Israel signaled its intent to shift to lower-intensity operations in Gaza. The IDF also started to shift its focus from northern Gaza to prepare for a campaign in southern Gaza, including in the city of Rafah.

Israel’s push for a Rafah operation prompted a public backlash from the Biden administration. In May 2024, news outlets broke that the United States had paused a shipment of bombs to Israel. Administration officials cited concerns that the weapons—primarily 2,000-pound bombs—could cause an unacceptable number of civilian casualties if used in Rafah’s dense, urban environment, where over a million Gazan civilians were sheltering at the time. A week later, President Biden publicly stated that he had warned Netanyahu the United States would withhold certain offensive weapons, including bombs and artillery shells, if the Israeli military launched an operation Rafah. The Biden administration ultimately did not act on this threat as it determined Israel’s campaign in Rafah was sufficiently more targeted than its earlier operations during the war.

In the fall of 2024, while continuing operations in southern and central Gaza, the IDF launched a renewed offensive in northern Gaza, specifically around the Jabalia refugee camp. The stated goal was to eliminate Hamas militants who had begun regrouping in the area and filling the vacuum left after the Israeli military’s earlier operations. The IDF’s operations in Jabalia raised concerns among experts that Israel might be planning to implement the controversial “Generals’ Plan,” which advocates for a total siege of the area, including the withholding of humanitarian aid, to force the surrender of remaining Hamas militants. Between October 6 and December 31, 2024, the UN attempted to reach the besieged area 165 times. Of those attempts, Israeli authorities denied 149, while the remaining 16 faced impediments.

The war has raised humanitarian concerns beyond northern Gaza. Since the start of Israeli operations in 2023, multiple reports have documented the targeting of journalists, schools, and Israeli-designated humanitarian zones. Repeated Israeli attacks on medical sites, including hospitals and critical infrastructure, have led to a surge in diseases such as polio throughout the Strip. Violence against humanitarian workers has further exacerbated the crisis. In April 2024, an Israeli airstrike killed seven employees of the World Central Kitchen, and World Food Programme workers were shot in August of that year. These incidents have created a chilling effect on humanitarian agencies operating in Gaza, with many suspending or limiting their operations until they can better ensure their employees’ safety. Additionally, Israel’s ban on many dual-use items in Gaza has hindered humanitarian aid operations. In its efforts to prevent items with potential military applications from reaching Hamas, Israeli inspectors have rejected critical supplies, such as chlorine tablets for water purification, brought in by humanitarian organizations.

As of January 2025, 1.9 million Gazans—about 90 percent of Gaza’s population—have been displaced and are categorized as facing acute or catastrophic food insecurity. There are currently no functioning hospitals in Gaza. The war has led to over 46,000 Gazan deaths, of which the Israeli military estimates 17,000 were Hamas militants. Israel has argued in many cases that its actions were necessary because Hamas’s guerilla warfare tactics often involve fighters embedding themselves in civilian areas. The military has also cited military successes, including the June 2024 rescue of four living hostages in central Gaza and the elimination of Hamas’s top leadership, including the group’s leader Yahya Sinwar, military chief Mohammed Deif, and Deif’s deputy Marwan Issa. However, the United States has cautioned that it assesses Hamas has been able to recruit replacements for nearly all the fighters that it has lost so far due to the war’s radicalizing effects on Gazans.",Center For Preventive Action,https://microsites-live-backend.cfr.org/cdn/ff/I4UpRJEOLTGWCZfXjuLqx64tihDHg04MOVYREESAFrE/1696965119/public/2023-10/IsraelWar_02.jpg
Conflict in Yemen and the Red Sea,Published date not found (newspaper3k),https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/war-yemen,"Fighting between Houthi rebels and the Saudi coalition that backs Yemen’s internationally recognized government has largely subsided, but Houthis have repeatedly attacked ships transiting the Red Sea in response to Israel's war on Hamas. Dialogue between the Houthis and Saudi Arabia, along with Iranian-Saudi normalization, has provided hope for a negotiated solution. However, talks have yielded little progress and have been punctuated by violence. The Southern Transitional Council (STC) has also renewed calls for an independent southern Yemeni state, complicating peace prospects, and al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) attacks have surged. Meanwhile, the humanitarian crisis has not improved; 21.6 million people need aid, including 11 million children, and more than 4.5 million are displaced.

Background

Yemen’s civil war began in 2014 when Houthi insurgents—Shiite rebels with links to Iran and a history of rising up against the Sunni government—took control of Yemen’s capital and largest city, Sanaa, demanding lower fuel prices and a new government. Following failed negotiations, the rebels seized the presidential palace in January 2015, leading President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi and his government to resign. Beginning in March 2015, a coalition of Gulf states led by Saudi Arabia launched a campaign of economic isolation and air strikes against the Houthi insurgents, with U.S. logistical and intelligence support.

In February 2015, after escaping from Sanaa, Hadi rescinded his resignation, complicating the UN-supported transitional council formed to govern from the southern port city of Aden. However, a Houthi advance forced Hadi to flee Aden for exile in Saudi Arabia. While he attempted to return to Aden later that year, he ultimately ruled as president in exile.

The intervention of regional powers in Yemen’s conflict, including Iran and Gulf states led by Saudi Arabia, also drew the country into a regional proxy struggle along the broader Sunni-Shia divide. In June 2015, Saudi Arabia implemented a naval blockade to prevent Iran from supplying the Houthis. In response, Iran dispatched a naval convoy, raising the risk of military escalation between the two countries. The militarization of Yemen’s waters also drew the attention of the U.S. Navy, which has continued to seize Yemen-bound Iranian weapons. The blockade has been at the center of the humanitarian crisis throughout the conflict. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have also led an unrelenting air campaign, with their coalition carrying out over twenty-five thousand air strikes. These strikes have caused over nineteen thousand civilian casualties, and from 2021 to 2022 the Houthis responded with a spate of drone attacks on Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

On the battleground, the Houthis made fast progress at the start of the war, moving eastward to Marib and pushing south to Aden in early 2015. However, a Saudi intervention pushed the Houthis back north and west until the frontlines stabilized. A UN effort to broker peace talks between allied Houthi rebels and the internationally recognized Yemeni government stalled in the summer of 2016. In the south and east of the country, a growing al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) threatened the government’s control, though its influence has since waned.

In July 2016, the Houthis and the government of former President Saleh, ousted in 2011 after nearly thirty years in power, announced the formation of a political council to govern Sana’a and much of northern Yemen. However, in December 2017, Saleh broke with the Houthis and called for his followers to take up arms against them. Saleh was killed and his forces were defeated within two days. Meanwhile, Hadi and the internationally recognized governments faced their own challenge: the Southern Transitional Council (STC). Established in 2017, the STC grew out of the southern separatist movement that predates the civil war and controls areas in the southwest around and including Aden. A 2019 Saudi-brokered deal incorporated the STC into the internationally-recognized governments, but the faction could still present challenges.

In 2018, coalition forces made an offensive push on the coast northward to the strategic city of Hodeidah, the main seaport for northern Yemen. The fighting ended in a ceasefire and commitments to withdraw troops from the city; the ceasefire largely held, but fighting continued elsewhere. Taiz, Yemen’s third largest city, also remained a key point of contention, having been blockaded by the Houthis since 2015. In 2020, the UAE officially withdrew from Yemen, but it maintains extensive influence in the country.

In February 2021, Houthi rebels launched an offensive to seize Marib, the last stronghold of Yemen’s internationally recognized government, and in early March, Houthi rebels conducted missile air strikes in Saudi Arabia, including targeting oil tankers and facilities and international airports. The Saudi-led coalition responded to the increase in attacks with air strikes targeting Sanaa. The offensive was the deadliest clash since 2018, killing hundreds of fighters and complicating peace processes.

Meanwhile, the conflict has taken a heavy toll on Yemeni civilians, making Yemen the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. The UN estimates that 60 percent of the estimated 377,000 deaths in Yemen between 2015 and the beginning of 2022 were the result of indirect causes like food insecurity and lack of accessible health services. Two-thirds of the population, or 21.6 million Yemenis, remain in dire need of assistance. Five million are at risk of famine, and a cholera outbreak has affected over one million people. All sides of the conflict are reported to have violated human rights and international humanitarian law.

An economic crisis continues to compound the ongoing humanitarian crisis. In late 2019, the conflict led to the splintering of the economy into two broad economic zones under territories controlled by the Houthis and the Saudi-backed government. In the fall of 2021, the sharp depreciation of Yemen’s currency, particularly in government-controlled areas, significantly reduced people’s purchasing power and pushed many basic necessities even further out of reach, leading to widespread protests across cities in southern Yemen. Security forces forcefully responded to the protests.

Separate from the ongoing civil war, the United States is suspected of conducting counterterrorism operations in Yemen, relying mainly on air strikes to target al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and militants associated with the self-proclaimed Islamic State. The United States is deeply invested in combating terrorism and violent extremism in Yemen, having collaborated with the Yemeni government on counterterrorism since the bombing of the USS Cole in 2000. Since 2002, the United States has carried out nearly four hundred strikes in Yemen. In April 2016, the United States deployed a small team of forces to advise and assist Saudi-led troops to retake territory from AQAP. In January 2017, a U.S. Special Operations Forces raid in central Yemen killed one U.S. service member, several suspected AQAP-affiliated fighters, and an unknown number of Yemeni civilians. Breaking from previous U.S. policy, President Joe Biden announced an end to U.S. support for Saudi-led offensive operations in Yemen in February 2021 and revoked its designation of the Houthis as a terrorist organization. In January 2024, the Houthis were redesignated as a terrorist organization due to their recent attacks on ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.

In April 2022, Yemen’s internationally recognized but unpopular president, Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi, resigned after ten years in power to make way for a new seven-member presidential council more representative of Yemen’s political factions. Rashad al-Alimi, a Hadi advisor with close ties to Saudi Arabia and powerful Yemeni politicians, chairs the new council.

Recent Developments

Though a six-month UN-brokered cease-fire officially lapsed in October 2022, both sides have since refrained from major escalatory actions and hostility levels remain low. Peace talks between Saudi and Houthi officials, mediated by Oman, resumed in April 2023, accompanying ongoing UN mediation efforts. However, concrete progress remains elusive, and the first official Houthi visit to the Saudi capital since the war began, on September 14, yielded nothing beyond optimistic statements. The discussions were reportedly centered around a complete reopening of Houthi-controlled ports and Sanaa airport, reconstruction efforts, and a timeline for foreign forces to withdraw from Yemen. Negotiations have also been overshadowed by the suspension of the only commercial air route out of Sanaa and a late September Houthi drone strike that killed four Bahraini members of the Saudi-led coalition.

Talks between Iran and Saudi Arabia in April 2023, mediated by China, have raised hopes of a political settlement to end the conflict in Yemen. The talks led to a breakthrough agreement to re-establish diplomatic relations and re-open both sides' embassies after years of tension and hostility. Iran’s UN mission said that the agreement could accelerate efforts to renew the lapsed cease-fire.

While hostility between the two warring sides remains low, AQAP’s political violence surged in May and June, reaching the highest monthly level since November 2022. Most of the violence has been centered around Yemen’s Abyan and Shawba governates, where AQAP has used drones and IEDs to target forces affiliated with the STC. In August 2023, AQAP launched an explosion that killed a military commander and three soldiers from the Security Belt Forces, an armed group loyal to the STC. Earlier that month, AQAP fighters killed five troops from another force affiliated with the separatist council. The recent use of drones by AQAP in Yemen’s south is likely an attempt to reassert its influence in the area despite its waning influence, and some speculate that this sudden and sustained use of drones signals external support. Additionally, AQAP has continued its anti-separatist efforts, with another attack in early October targeting and wounding five STC-backed fighters.

Three days following the October 7 attack on Israel, Yemen’s Houthi leader Abdel-Malek al-Houthi warned that if the United States intervenes in the Hamas-Israel War directly, the group will respond by taking military action. In mid-October, U.S. officials announced that the USS Carney downed several Houthi cruise missiles and drones fired toward Israel. The Houthis continued to launch several rounds of missiles and drones until it officially announced entry into the war to support Palestinians in the Gaza Strip on October 31. Houthi attacks of the same nature continued into November. On November 19, the Houthis hijacked a commercial ship in the Red Sea and have since attacked at least thirty-three others with drones, missiles, and speed boats as of late January 2024. As a result, major shipping companies have stopped using the Red Sea—through which almost 15 percent of global seaborne trade passes—and have rerouted to take longer and costlier journeys around Southern Africa instead. The situation has resulted in heightened shipping and insurance costs, stoking fears of a renewed cost-of-living crisis. In response to the consistent Houthi attacks in the Red Sea, the United States and United Kingdom carried out coordinated air strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen on January 11 and January 22. It is unclear whether the attacks will cease in the near future, with the Houthis vowing to persist in their military operations until a ceasefire is agreed to in the Gaza Strip and aid is allowed into the enclave.",Center For Preventive Action,https://microsites-live-backend.cfr.org/cdn/ff/xoVVTA0bONOrF8P3aoRczQ1f-l_zXDj5pgoFAplJNvY/1615823492/public/2019-07/RTR4Y56U_Yemen.jpg
Yemeni civil war (2014–present),Published date not found (newspaper3k),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%93present),"Ongoing civil war in the state of Yemen

The Yemeni civil war (Arabic: الحرب الأهلية اليمنية, romanized: al-ḥarb al-ʾahlīyah al-yamanīyah) is an ongoing multilateral civil war that began in late 2014 mainly between the Rashad al-Alimi-led Presidential Leadership Council and the Mahdi al-Mashat-led Supreme Political Council, along with their supporters and allies. Both claim to constitute the official government of Yemen.[116]

The civil war began in September 2014 when Houthi forces took over the capital city Sanaa, which was followed by a rapid Houthi takeover of the government. On 21 March 2015, the Houthi-led Supreme Revolutionary Committee declared a general mobilization to overthrow then-president Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi and expand their control by driving into southern provinces.[117] The Houthi offensive, allied with military forces loyal to former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh, began fighting the next day in Lahij Governorate. By 25 March, Lahij fell to the Houthis and they reached the outskirts of Aden, the seat of power for Hadi's government.[118] Hadi fled the country the same day.[119][120] Concurrently, a coalition led by Saudi Arabia launched military operations by using air strikes and restored the former Yemeni government.[21] Although there has been no direct intervention by the Iranian government in Yemen, the civil war is widely regarded as part of the Iran-Saudi proxy conflict.[b]

Houthi insurgents currently control the capital Sanaa and all of former North Yemen except for eastern Marib Governorate. After the formation of the Southern Transitional Council (STC) in 2017 and the subsequent capture of Aden by the STC forces in 2018, the pro-republican forces became fractured, with regular clashes between pro-Hadi forces backed by Saudi Arabia and southern separatists backed by the United Arab Emirates.[121] Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and the Islamic State have also carried out attacks against both factions, with AQAP controlling swathes of territory in the hinterlands, and along stretches of the coast.[122]

The UN brokered a two-month nationwide truce on 2 April 2022 between Yemen's warring parties, which allowed fuel imports into Houthi-held areas and some flights to operate from Sanaa International Airport to Jordan and Egypt.[123] On 7 April 2022, the Hadi government was dissolved and the Presidential Leadership Council (PLC) took command of the Yemeni Republic, incorporating the Southern Transitional Council into its new government. The UN announced on 2 June 2022 that the nationwide truce had been further extended by two months.[124] According to the UN, over 150,000 people have been killed in Yemen,[125] as well as estimates of more than 227,000 dead as a result of an ongoing famine and lack of healthcare facilities due to the war.[126][110][127] The Wall Street Journal reported in March 2023 that Iran agreed to halt all military support to the Houthis and abide by the UN arms embargo, as part of a Chinese-brokered Iran-Saudi rapprochement deal. The agreement is viewed as part of Saudi Arabian-led efforts to pressure the Houthi militants to end the conflict through negotiated settlement; with Saudi and U.S. officials describing the concomitant Iranian behaviour as a ""litmus test"" for the endurance of the Chinese-brokered détente.[c] Since then, however, Iran has maintained military and logistical support to the Houthis.[128][129] On 23 December 2023, Hans Grundberg, the UN special envoy for Yemen, announced that the warring parties committed to steps towards a ceasefire.[130]

The Saudi-led coalition's bombing of civilian areas has received condemnation from the international community.[131] According to the Yemen Data Project, the bombing campaign has killed or injured an estimated 19,196 civilians as of March 2022.[132] Houthi drone attacks targeting civilian areas in Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Southern Yemen have also attracted global condemnation;[d] and the UN Security Council has imposed a global arms embargo on the Houthis since 2015.[e] The United States has provided intelligence and logistical support for the Saudi Arabian-led campaign,[19] and despite the Biden administration's pledge to withdraw U.S. support for Saudi Arabia in Yemen, it has announced the sale of weapons to the Saudi Arabian-led coalition.[133][134]

Historical context [ edit ]

Islam in Yemen predominantly takes the form of Sunni and Shia Islam.[135] Among the Shia, the Ismaili and Zaydi sects historically competed for influence.[136] Following the fall of the Ismaili states ruled by the Hamdan tribe in the 11th century, the Ayyubid expansion led to the majority of the Hamdan tribe converting to Zaydism, a Shia sect.[137]

During the Rasulid period, Shafi'i Sunni Islam gained popularity in Yemen.[138] Over time, the Zaydis in the north and the Rasulid rulers in the south competed for dominance. This rivalry diminished following the decline of Rasulid rule and the increasing involvement of imperial powers in the Middle East, including the Ottoman Empire.[137]

The defeat of the Ottomans in the first World War eventually gave way to the first (incomplete) unification of Yemen. This was possible during the Hamid al-Din dynasty under Imam Yahya and his son's rule. The unification also meant the establishment of a hierarchy within which Zaydis had authoritative power over Sunnis.[137] As a consequence, the difference in status became instituted and normalized. The Hamid al-Din dynasty faced the Zaydis' discontent due to a non-conformity to Zaydi traditions, thus coming to an end with the overthrow of Imam Yahya's grandson, Imam Badr, in 1962. What followed was a civil war in which republicans opposed royalists. Helen Lackner explains that such a division was not ideological; it was based on past feuds. Nonetheless, external powers like Saudi Arabia intervened for ideological motives, as the latter sought to maintain the monarchy system which it adhered to itself. Despite Saudi Arabia's original intentions, in 1970, the republican form was retained.[137]

While these developments took place in the North, liberation movements against British presence broke out, amounting to the creation of a socialist state, hence Soviet Union ally, in the Southern Arabian region. It was named the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY).[137]

The PDRY was involved in the internal disputes of its northern counterpart. It had previously supported the republicans in fighting off Saudi Arabia's influence, but it was the Hamdi regime in the Yemen Arab Republic (North Yemen) that was most notorious for its policies that aimed to reduce Saudi presence in Yemeni politics. His rule was, nonetheless, short-lived. A series of political unrest marked by the assassination of former presidents, led to Colonel Ali Abdullah Saleh's rise to the presidency of the Yemen Arab Republic. Saleh's rule lasted for 33 years. The major event that marked his regime was the unification of Yemen in 1990. His attempt was not entirely successful as a civil war broke out in 1994. However, he was able to come out of it victorious. Subsequently, the Republic of Yemen became constitutionally established.[137]

Saleh tried to maintain his position through constitutional amendments, hoping for his son to take over, but strong opposition and protests pressured him out of office. Meanwhile, the group ""Friends of Yemen"" was created, initially to stop al-Qaeda on the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) after evidence pointed at it as the main perpetrator behind multiple attacks on US military bases and equipment. The ""Friends of Yemen"" group became more involved in Yemen during the Arab Spring, after the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and United Nations recommended that the management of Yemen's ""crisis"" be put in the hands of global actors.[139]

The Houthis [ edit ]

After the end of their rule, from the 1960s onwards, Zaydis faced discrimination and Sunnification policies from the consequent Sunni dominated governments. For example, Salafis in Saada claimed al-Shawkani as an intellectual precursor, and future Yemeni regimes would uphold his Sunnization policies as a unifier of the country[140] and to undermine Zaydi Shi'ism.[141]

Ansar Allah (sometimes Anglicised as Ansarullah), known popularly as the Houthis, is a Zaydi group with its origins in the mountainous Sa'dah Governorate on Yemen's northern border with Saudi Arabia. They led a low-level insurgency against the Yemeni government in 2004[142] after their leader, Hussein Badreddin al-Houthi, was killed in a government military crackdown[143][144] following his protests against government policies.[145][146]

The intensity of the conflict waxed and waned over the course of the 2000s, with multiple peace agreements being negotiated and later disregarded.[147][148] The Houthi insurgency heated up in 2009, briefly drawing neighboring Saudi Arabia to the side of the Yemeni government, but cooled the following year after a ceasefire was signed.[149][150]

Then during the early stages of the Yemeni Revolution in 2011, Houthi leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi declared the group's support for demonstrations calling for the resignation of President Ali Abdullah Saleh.[151] Later that year, as Saleh prepared to leave office, the Houthis laid siege to the Salafi-majority village of Dammaj in northern Yemen, a step toward attaining virtual autonomy for Sa'dah.[152]

The Houthis boycotted a single-candidate election in early 2012 meant to give Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi a two-year term of office.[153] They participated in a National Dialogue Conference, but withheld support from a final accord in early 2014 that extended Hadi's mandate in office for another year.[154][155]

Conflict between the Houthis and Sunni tribes in northern Yemen spread to other governorates, including the Sanaa Governorate by mid-2014.[156]

Course of the conflict [ edit ]

Beginning of the conflict [ edit ]

After several weeks of street protests against the Hadi administration, which made cuts to fuel subsidies that were unpopular with the group, the Houthis fought the Yemen Army forces under the command of General Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar. In a battle that lasted only a few days, Houthi fighters seized control of Sanaa, the Yemeni capital, in September 2014.[157] The Houthis forced President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi to negotiate an agreement to end the violence, in which the government resigned and the Houthis gained an unprecedented level of influence over state institutions and politics.[158][159]

In January 2015, unhappy with a proposal to split the country into six federal regions,[160] Houthi fighters seized the presidential compound in Sanaa. The power play prompted the resignation of President Hadi and his ministers.[155][161] The Houthi political leadership then announced the dissolution of parliament and the formation of a Revolutionary Committee to govern the country on 6 February 2015.[162]

On 21 February, one month after Houthi militants confined Hadi to his residence in Sanaʽa, he slipped out of the capital and traveled to Aden. In a televised address from his hometown, he declared that the Houthi takeover was illegitimate and indicated he remained the constitutional president of Yemen.[163][164][165] His predecessor as president, Ali Abdullah Saleh—who had been widely suspected of aiding the Houthis during their takeover of Sanaʽa the previous year—publicly denounced Hadi and called on him to go into exile.[166]

On 19 March 2015, the troops loyal to Hadi clashed with those who refused to recognize his authority in the Battle of Aden Airport. The forces under General Abdul-Hafez al-Saqqaf were defeated, and al-Saqqaf fled toward Sanaʽa.[167] In apparent retaliation for the routing of al-Saqqaf, warplanes reportedly flown by Houthi pilots bombed Hadi's compound in Aden.[168]

After the 20 March 2015 Sanaa mosque bombings, in a televised speech, Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, the leader of the Houthis, said his group's decision to mobilize for war was ""imperative"" under current circumstances and that Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and its affiliates—among whom he counts Hadi—would be targeted, as opposed to southern Yemen and its citizens.[169] President Hadi declared Aden to be Yemen's temporary capital while Sanaʽa remained under Houthi control.[170][171]

Also, the same day as the mosque bombings, al-Qaeda militants captured the provincial capital of Lahij, Al Houta District after killing about 20 soldiers before being driven out several hours later.[172]

Hadi reiterated in a speech on 21 March 2015 that he was the legitimate president of Yemen and declared, ""We will restore security to the country and hoist the flag of Yemen in Sanaʽa, instead of the Iranian flag.""[173] He also declared Aden to be Yemen's ""economic and temporary capital"" due to the Houthi occupation of Sanaʽa, which he pledged would be retaken.[174]

In Sanaa, the Houthi Revolutionary Committee appointed Major General Hussein Khairan as Yemen's new Defence Minister and placed him in overall command of the military offensive.[175][176]

Foreign involvement [ edit ]

Houthi allies [ edit ]

In April 2015, United States National Security Council spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan stated that: ""It remains our assessment that Iran does not exert command and control over the Houthis in Yemen"".[177][178]

The United States has regularly accused the Iranian government of arming and funding the Houthis. In an April 2015 interview with the PBS Newshour, then-U.S. secretary of state John Kerry accused Iran of attempting to destabilize Yemen.[179] While the Houthis and the Iranian government have denied any military affiliation,[180] Iranian supreme leader Ali Khamenei openly announced his ""spiritual"" support of the movement in a personal meeting with the Houthi spokesperson Mohammed Abdul Salam in Tehran, in the midst of ongoing conflicts in Aden in 2019.[181][182]

Although there has been no direct intervention by the Iranian government, the Yemeni civil war is widely regarded as part of the Iran-Saudi proxy conflict.[f] The United States, Saudi Arabia, UAE and various Western commentators have accused various IRGC networks of assisting Houthis through arms supplies, military training, logistics, strategic co-ordination and media support.[183][184][185] Saudi Arabia views activities by the Quds Forces and Hezbollah in neighboring Yemen as part of Iranian attempts to establish a satellite state in the country and trap them into a stalemate.[186][187] Western commentators have argued that the Iranian policy in Yemen has been hinged on developing bases for ballistic missiles targeting GCC countries, establishing naval dominance in the strategic Bab al-Mandeb Strait by advancing area denial capabilities and weapons trafficking, in addition to the intensification of Iranian cyberwarfare.[183][188] However, this characterization has been disputed by various analysts and academics, who assert that Houthis are independent of Iran. According to professor Stephen Zunes, the majority of Houthi arms supplies primarily originate from the black market, and Houthis obtain most of their weaponry from non-Iranian sources.[189]

On 7 August 2018, IRGC commander Nasser Shabani was quoted by the Fars News Agency, the semi-official news agency of the Iranian government, as saying, ""We (IRGC) told Yemenis [Houthi rebels] to strike two Saudi oil tankers, and they did it"".[190][191] The Wall Street Journal reported in March 2023 that the Iranian government agreed to halt all military support to Houthis and abide by the UN arms embargo, as part of a Chinese-brokered Iran-Saudi rapprochement deal.[g]

The Eritrean government has also been accused of funneling Iranian material to the Houthis,[192] as well as offering medical care for injured Houthi fighters.[193] However, it has called the allegations ""groundless"" and said after the outbreak of open hostilities that it views the Yemeni crisis ""as an internal matter"".[192] According to a secret United Nations document, North Korea had aided the Houthis by selling weapons.[194][195]

Yemeni government supporters [ edit ]

The Yemeni government meanwhile has enjoyed significant international backing from the United States and Persian Gulf monarchies after requesting their support.[196][197][198] U.S. drone strikes were conducted regularly in Yemen during Hadi's presidency in Sanaa, usually targeting Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.[199] The United States was also a major supplier of weapons to the Yemeni government, although according to the Pentagon, hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of that material has gone missing since it was delivered.[200] Saudi Arabia provided financial aid to Yemen until late 2014, when it suspended it amid the Houthis' takeover of Sanaʽa and increasing influence over the Yemeni government.[201] According to Amnesty International, the United Kingdom also supplied weaponry used by Saudi-led coalition to strike targets in Yemen.[202] Amnesty International also says that U.S.-based Raytheon Company supplied a laser-guided bomb that killed six civilians on 28 June 2019.[203]

In May 2019, State Secretary Mike Pompeo announced an ""emergency"" to push through $8.1 billion of arms sales to Gulf allies like Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Jordan, citing Iranian activity in the Middle East. Despite widespread congressional opposition, an August 2020 report by the Office of Inspector General detailed that Pompeo complied with the legal prerequisites to do so. The report, however, also noted that the possible threat to the lives of the civilians caught in the crossfire was not assessed properly at the time of the emergency. The State Department was also accused in the report of violating the threshold of the Arms Export Control Act while approving arms sales to Gulf states.[204]

Saudi-led intervention in Yemen [ edit ]

A pro-Saleh protest in Sanaa against the Saudi-led intervention, March 2016

In response to rumors that Saudi Arabia could intervene in Yemen, Houthi commander Ali al-Shami boasted on 24 March 2015 that his forces would invade the larger kingdom and not stop at Mecca, but rather Riyadh.[205]

The following evening, answering a request by Yemen's internationally recognized government, Saudi Arabia began a military intervention alongside eight other Arab states and with the logistical support of the United States against the Houthis, bombing positions throughout Sanaʽa. In a joint statement, the nations of the Gulf Cooperation Council (with the exception of Oman) said they decided to intervene against the Houthis in Yemen at the request of Hadi's government.[206][207][208] King Salman of Saudi Arabia declared the Royal Saudi Air Force to be in full control of Yemeni airspace within hours of the operation beginning.[209] The airstrikes were aimed at hindering the Houthis' advance toward Hadi's stronghold in southern Yemen.[210]

Al Jazeera reported that Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, a Houthi commander appointed in February as President of the Revolutionary Committee, was injured by an airstrike in Sanaʽa on the first night of the campaign.[211]

After the launch of Operation Decisive Storm, Saudi Arabia along with the UAE used lobbying in an attempt to rally the international community to their cause.[139]

Reuters reported that planes from Egypt, Morocco, Jordan, Sudan, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, and Bahrain had also taken part in the operation.[21] Saudi Arabia requested that Pakistan commit forces as well, but Pakistan's parliament officially voted to remain neutral.[212] However, Pakistan agreed to provide support in line with a United Nations Security Council resolution, dispatching warships to enforce an arms embargo against the Houthis.[66][213]

On 21 April 2015, the bombing campaign was officially declared over, with Saudi officials saying they would begin Operation Restoring Hope as a combination of political, diplomatic, and military efforts to end the war.[214] Even still, airstrikes continued against Houthi targets, and fighting in Aden and Ad Dali' went on.[215]

The United Arab Emirates claimed to take an active role against fighting AQAP and IS-YP presence in Yemen through a partnership with the United States. In an Op-Ed in The Washington Post, Yousef Al Otaiba, the UAE ambassador to the United States, described that the intervention has reduced AQAP presence in Yemen to its weakest point since 2012 with many areas previously under their control liberated.[216] The ambassador claimed that more than 2,000 militants have been removed from the battlefield, with their controlled areas now having improved security and a better delivered humanitarian and development assistance such as to the port city of Mukalla and other liberated areas.[216]

An Associated Press investigation outlined that the military coalition in Yemen actively reduced AQAP in Yemen without military intervention, instead of by offering them deals and even actively recruiting them in the coalition because ""they're considered exceptional fighters"".[217] UAE Brigadier General Musallam Al Rashidi responded to the accusations by stating that Al Qaeda cannot be reasoned with and cited that they killed many of his soldiers.[218] The UAE military stated that accusations of allowing AQAP to leave with cash contradict their primary objective of depriving AQAP of its financial strength.[219] The notion of the coalition recruiting or paying AQAP has been thoroughly denied by the United States Pentagon with Colonel Robert Manning, spokesperson of the Pentagon, calling the news source ""patently false"".[220] The governor of Hadramut Faraj al-Bahsani, dismissed the accusations that Al Qaeda has joined with the coalition rank, explaining that if they did there would be sleeper cells and that he would be ""the first one to be killed"". According to The Independent, AQAP activity on social media as well as the number of terror attacks conducted by them has decreased since the Emirati intervention.[219]

On 13 July 2020, the UK Ministry of Defence logged more than 500 Saudi air raids in possible breach of international law in Yemen. These figures were revealed a few days after the UK government decided to resume the arms sales to Saudi Arabia, which could be used in the Yemen war, just over a year after the court of appeal ruled them unlawful. It justified resuming the arms sales stating that only isolated incidents without any pattern have occurred.[221]

In March 2019, the United States Congress voted to end US support to the Saudi war effort;[222] however, US President Donald Trump vetoed it.[223] His successor, President Joe Biden, announced a freeze on arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the UAE in January 2021.[224] He also declared that he would end American support for the Saudi coalition.[225] On 4 February 2021, Biden announced an end to the US support for Saudi-led operations in Yemen.[226] As of 13 April 2021, arms sales to the UAE have not been stopped, while sales to Saudi Arabia continued to be paused.[227] However, the details of the end of American involvement in the war have yet to be released.[228]

In August 2020, confidential Saudi documents revealed the kingdom's strategy in Yemen. The 162 pages of classified Saudi documents dates back prior to 2015. The pages showed the kingdom's inaction in stopping the Houthis from capturing Sanaa, despite Saudi intelligence reports. The records also exposed that Saudi Arabia had worked to hamper the rebuilding projects commissioned by Germany and Qatar in Saada. This happened after the fighting between the two warring camps came to a halt due to a ceasefire.[229]

Arab League [ edit ]

In Egypt, the Yemeni foreign minister called for an Arab League military intervention against the Houthis.[206] Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi floated the idea of a unified military force.[230]

The Arab League announced the formation of a unified military force to respond to conflict in Yemen and Libya.[231]

US role [ edit ]

Since the mid-2000s, the United States has been carrying out targeted killings of Al-Qaeda militants in Yemen, although the U.S. government generally does not confirm involvement in specific attacks conducted by unmanned aerial vehicles as a matter of policy. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism documented 415 strikes in Pakistan and Yemen by 2015 since the September 11 attacks, and according to the organization's estimates, between 423 and 962 deaths are believed to have been civilians. Michael Morell, former deputy director of the CIA, claims the numbers were significantly lower.[232]

During the civil war in Yemen, drone strikes have continued, targeting suspected leaders of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Ibrahim al-Rubeish and Nasser bin Ali al-Ansi, two leading AQAP figures, were killed by U.S. drone strikes in the vicinity of Mukalla in 2015.[233][234] Approximately 240 suspected AQAP militants have been killed by American drone strikes since the civil war began.[235]

On 2013, Radhya Al-Mutawakel and Abdelrasheed Al-Faqih, Directors of Mwatana, published a joint report with Open Society Foundations titled 'Death by Drone', detailing evidence of civilian casualties and damage to civilian objects in nine US drone strikes.[236]

The United States supplied intelligence and logistical support, including aerial refueling and search and rescue for downed coalition pilots.[237] Also, US revved arms sales to coalition countries.[238] In January 2016, Saudi Arabia's foreign minister stated: US and UK military officials were in the command and control center responsible for the Saudi-led airstrikes in Yemen and had access to the list of targets but were not involved in the selection of targets.[239][240][241]

In March 2025, the United States launched air and naval attacks against dozens of Houthi targets in Yemen, the largest military operation in the Middle East of United States President Donald Trump’s second term.[242] US officials said that the first wave of attacks, launched on 15 March against radars, air defenses, and missile and drone systems, were the first in a wider effort to end Houthi attacks on commercial vessels and warships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.[243]

Islamic State presence and operations [ edit ]

The Islamic State (IS) has proclaimed several provinces in Yemen and has urged its adherents to wage war against the Houthi movement, as well as against Zaydis in general.[244] ISIS militants have conducted bombing attacks in various parts of the country, particularly against mosques in Sanaʽa.[245][246]

On 6 October 2015, IS militants conducted a series of suicide bombings in Aden that killed 15 soldiers affiliated with the Hadi-led government and the Saudi-led coalition.[247] The attacks were directed against the al-Qasr hotel, which had been a headquarters for pro-Hadi officials, and also military facilities.[247] Yemeni officials and UAE state news agency declared that 11 Yemeni and 4 United Arab Emirates soldiers were killed in Aden due to 4 coordinated Islamic State suicide bombings. Prior to the claim of responsibility by the Islamic State, UAE officials blamed the Houthis and former president Ali Abdullah Saleh, for the attacks.[247]

Humanitarian situation [ edit ]

CNN reported on 8 April 2015 that almost 10,160,000 Yemenis were deprived of water, food, and electricity as a result of the conflict. The report also added per source from UNICEF officials in Yemen that within 15 days, some 100,000 people across the country were dislocated, while Oxfam said that more than 10 million Yemenis did not have enough food to eat, in addition to 850,000 half-starved children. Over 13 million civilians were without access to clean water.[248]

A medical aid boat brought 2.5 tonnes of medicine to Aden on 8 April 2015.[249] A UNICEF plane loaded with 16 tonnes of supplies landed in Sanaa on 10 April.[250] The United Nations announced on 19 April 2015 that Saudi Arabia promised to provide $273.7 million in emergency humanitarian aid to Yemen. The UN appealed for the aid, saying 7.5 million people had been affected by the conflict and many were in need of medical supplies, potable water, food, shelter, and other forms of support.[251]

On 12 May 2015, Oxfam warned that the five days a humanitarian ceasefire was scheduled to last would not be sufficient to fully address Yemen's humanitarian crisis.[252] It has also been said that the Houthis are collecting a war tax on goods. The political analyst Abdulghani al-Iryani affirmed that this tax is: ""an illegal levy, mostly extortion that is not determined by the law and the amount is at the discretion of the field commanders"".[253]

As the war dragged on through the summer and into the fall, things were made far worse when Cyclone Chapala, the equivalent of a category 2 Hurricane,[254] made landfall on 3 November 2015. According to the NGO Save the Children, the destruction of healthcare facilities and a healthcare system on the brink of collapse as a result of the war will cause an estimated 10,000 preventable child deaths annually. Some 1,219 children have died as a direct result of the conflict thus far. Edward Santiago, the NGO's Yemen director, asserted in December 2016:[255]

Even before the war tens of thousands of Yemeni children were dying of preventable causes. But now, the situation is much worse and an estimated 1,000 children are dying every week from preventable killers like diarrhea, malnutrition, and respiratory tract infections.

In March 2017, the World Food Program reported that while Yemen was not yet in a full-blown famine, 60% of Yemenis, or 17 million people, were in ""crisis"" or ""emergency"" food situations.[256]

In June 2017, a cholera epidemic resurfaced which was reported to be killing a person an hour in Yemen by mid June.[257] News reports in mid June stated that there had been 124,000 cases and 900 deaths and that 20 of the 22 provinces in Yemen were affected at that time.[258] UNICEF and WHO estimated that, by 24 June 2017, the total cases in the country exceeded 200,000, with 1,300 deaths.[259] 77.7% of cholera cases (339,061 of 436,625) and 80.7% of deaths from cholera (1,545 of 1,915) occurred in Houthi-controlled governorates, compared to 15.4% of cases and 10.4% of deaths in government-controlled governorates, since Houthi-controlled areas have been disproportionately affected by the conflict, which has created conditions conducive to the spread of cholera.[260]

On 7 June 2018, it was reported that the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) had pulled 71 of its international staff out of Yemen, and moved the rest of them to Djibouti, with some 450 ICRC employees remaining in the country. The partial evacuation measure came on the eve of an ICRC worker, a Lebanese national, being killed on 21 April by unknown gunmen in the southwestern city of Taiz. The ICRC stated, ""our current activities have been blocked, threatened and directly targeted in recent weeks, and we see a vigorous attempt to instrumentalize our organization as a pawn in the conflict."" In light of the serious security deterioration for ICRC personnel, the international organization has called for all parties of the conflict ""to provide it with concrete, solid and actionable guarantees so that it can continue working in Yemen."" Since the beginning of the conflict, more than 10,000 people have been killed and at least 40,000 wounded, mostly from air raids.[261]

Protest against the war in Yemen on 14 August 2020

The International Rescue Committee stated in March that at least 9.8 million people in Yemen were acutely in need of health services. The closure of Sanaʽa and Riyan airports for civilian flights and the limited operation of civilian airplanes in government-held areas, made it impossible for most to seek medical treatment abroad. The cost of tickets provided by Yemenia, Air Djibouti and Queen Bilqis Airways, also put traveling outside Yemen out of reach for many.[262][263]

The United Nations Development Programme published a report in September 2019 that said if the war continues, Yemen will become the poorest country in the world, with 79% of the population living below the poverty line and 65% in extreme poverty by 2022.[264]

On 3 December 2019, the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, Amnesty International released a report highlighting how the almost 5-year old Yemen war has left millions of people living with disabilities and excluded from medical attention. The armed conflict led by Saudi Arabia and UAE as part of the former's coalition in the Arab nation against Houthis and terror groups, has given birth to the worst humanitarian crisis, as stated by the United Nations.[265]

Humanitarian aid provided to Houthi-controlled Yemen will be scaled-down in March 2020 because donors doubt if it's actually reaching the people in need, UN official said.[266]

In June 2020, the UNHCR said that following more than five years of war in Yemen, more than 3.6 million people have been forced to flee their homes, while 24 million are in dire need of aid. The group also informed that a significant gap in funding has been recorded with only US$63 million received thus far, while at least US$211.9 million is needed to run the operations in 2020.[267]

On 2 July 2020, Human Rights Watch reported that detainees at Aden's Bir Ahmed facility were facing serious health risks from the rapidly spreading coronavirus pandemic. The informal detention facility, controlled by Yemeni authorities affiliated with the UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council, is grossly overcrowded and was deprived of health care facilities.[268]

The World Food Programme (WFP) projected in March 2021 that if the Saudi-led blockade and war continues, more than 400,000 Yemeni children under 5 years old could die from acute malnutrition before the end of the year as the blockade devastates nation.[269][270][271]

War crime accusations [ edit ]

According to Farea Al-Muslim, direct war crimes have been committed during the conflict; for example, an IDP camp was hit by a Saudi airstrike, while Houthis have sometimes prevented aid workers from giving aid.[272] The UN and several major human rights groups discussed the possibility that war crimes may have been committed by Saudi Arabia during the air campaign.[273][274]

Yemeni capital Sanaa after airstrikes, 9 October 2015

British researcher Alex de Waal wrote that the ""responsibility for Yemen goes beyond Riyadh and Abu Dhabi to London and Washington. Britain has sold at least £4.5 billion in arms to Saudi Arabia and £500 million to the UAE since the war began. The US role is even bigger: Trump authorized arms sales to the Saudis worth $110 billion last May. Yemen will be the defining famine crime of this generation, perhaps this century.""[275]

In August 2018, a report by UN experts said all parties to the conflict may have committed war crimes, including the governments of Yemen, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, and the Houthi movement. The UN described the conflict as the world's worst humanitarian crisis. The report documented 6,475 deaths in the conflict, but estimated the true number was significantly higher. The report criticized Saudi-led airstrikes and accused parties of unlawful violations such as ""deprivation of the right to life, arbitrary detention, rape, torture, enforced disappearances and child recruitment"".[276]

In February 2020, British law firm Stoke White appealed the authorities in Britain, the U.S., and Turkey to arrest senior officials from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for allegedly carrying out war crimes and torture in Yemen. The complaints were lodged under the provision of 'universal jurisdiction', wherein the nations must probe breaches of the Geneva Convention for possible war crimes.[277]

In March 2020, Human Rights Watch accused Saudi military forces and Saudi-backed Yemeni forces of carrying out abuse of Yemeni civilians in the country's eastern province of al-Mahrah. They accused them arbitrarily arresting, torturing, and illegally transferring detainees to the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The report documented 16 cases of arbitrary detention and five cases of detainees who had been transferred illegally to Saudi Arabia.[278][279] According to a report from May 2020 by Yemeni human rights group Mwatana, since May 2016, more than 1,600 cases of arbitrary detentions, 770 forced disappearances, 344 cases of torture and at least 66 deaths in unofficial prisons have been documented. The report stated that Houthis were responsible for most abuses. It blamed them for 350 forced disappearances, 138 incidents of torture, and 27 deaths in detention, while UAE-backed forces, including the Southern Transitional Council, were responsible for 327 disappearances, 141 cases of torture, and 25 deaths in detention. The report blamed forces loyal to the Saudi-backed Yemeni government for 65 cases of torture and over 24 deaths.[280]

An investigation led by Sky News reported that on 12 July 2020, an air-strike in Northern Yemen, reportedly carried out by the Saudi-led coalition, hit a family home, killing six children and three women. The investigators found fragments of the bomb and some of the shrapnel which seemed to be the part of a GBU-12, 500 lb fin-guided bomb, manufactured in the US. The Joint Incidents Assessment Team is still investigating the attack.[281]

The United Nations has accused both sides of the conflict of using child soldiers. In August 2018, the UN reported that two-thirds of child soldiers in Yemen fought for the Houthis. The report documented 800 cases of child soldiers in 2017.[282][283] In December 2018, The New York Times reported that Saudi Arabia had hired Child Soldiers from Sudan (especially from Darfur), and Yemen to fight against Houthis. They reported that as many as 14,000 Sudanese militiamen were fighting in the war, many of them children.[284][285][286] In March 2019, it was reported that British SAS special forces had allegedly been involved in training child soldiers in Yemen.[287] In March 2019, Al Jazeera reported that Saudi Arabia recruited Yemeni children to guard the Saudi Arabia-Yemen border against Houthis.[283] In January 2022, the UN reported that 1,406 child soldiers recruited by the Houthis had died on the battlefield in 2020 and 562 had died between January and May 2021.[288]

In February 2022, unknown armed men kidnapped five United Nations personnel in southern Yemen as they were returning to Aden after a field tour. According to Russell Geekie, a spokesman for the top UN official in Yemen, the crew was kidnapped on Friday, 11 February 2022, in the Abyan governorate.[289] In August 2023, the kidnapped United Nations personnel were released.[290]

Impact on citizens [ edit ]

Children and women [ edit ]

According to UN estimates, the war has directly caused the death of over 3,000 children as of December 2020 ; while indirect causes of the war (lack of food, health and infrastructure) have led to additional deaths.[291] The UN estimates that at the end of 2021, 70% of all the casualties of the war (around 259,000) are children under five.[292][better source needed]

Yemeni refugee women and children are extremely susceptible to smuggling and human trafficking.[293] NGOs report that vulnerable populations in Yemen were at increased risk for human trafficking in 2015 because of ongoing armed conflict, civil unrest, and lawlessness. Migrant workers from Somalia who remained in Yemen during this period suffered from increased violence, and women and children became most vulnerable to human trafficking. Prostitution on women and child sex slaves is a social issue in Yemen. Citizens of other gulf states are beginning to be drawn into the sex tourism industry. The poorest people in Yemen work locally and children are commonly sold as sex slaves abroad. While this issue is worsening, the plight of Somalis in Yemen has been ignored by the government.[294] Emphasizing the dire humanitarian needs for about 23.4 million people, UNFPA reported the lack of access to sexual and reproductive health and protection services, and exposure to death in pregnancy and childbirth and life-threatening violence. An increase in child marriage as a coping mechanism by impoverished families as the conflict continues was also reported.[295]

Children are recruited between the ages of 13 and 17, and as young as 10 years old into armed forces despite a law against it in 1991. The rate of militant recruitment in Yemen increases exponentially. According to an international organization, between 26 March and 24 April 2015, armed groups recruited at least 140 children.[296] According to the New York Times report, 1.8 million children in Yemen are extremely subject to malnutrition in 2018.[297]

Both the Saudi-led coalition and the Houthis were blacklisted by the UN over the deaths of children during the war. In 2016 Saudi Arabia was removed from the list after alleged pressure from Gulf countries who threatened to withdraw hundreds of millions of dollars in assistance to the UN, the decision was criticized by human rights groups and the coalition added again in 2017 and was accused of killing or injuring 683 children, and attacking many of schools and hospitals in 38 confirmed attacks, while the Houthis were accused of being responsible for 414 child casualties in 2016.[298][299][300] On 16 June 2020, the United Nations removed the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen war from an annual blacklist of parties violating children's rights. The decision was taken despite the UN finding that the coalition operations killed or injured nearly 222 children in Yemen, in 2019. The Saudi-led coalition's removal from the blacklist leaves Yemeni children vulnerable to future attacks.[301]

In mid-May 2019, a series of Saudi/Emirati-led airstrikes hit Houthi targets on the outskirts of Sanaa. One of the airstrikes destroyed several homes, killing five civilians and injuring more than 30. According to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project, while 4,800 of about 7,000 civilian fatalities have been caused by the Saudi-led coalition since 2016, the Houthis are accountable for 1,300 civilian deaths.[302]

According to a 2019 report by UNICEF, two million children had dropped out of school in Yemen since the conflict began in March 2015. The education of other 3.7 million children was endangered because teachers had not been paid since 2017.[303]

On 9 October 2019, children's advocacy group, Save the Children warned of a significant rise in cholera cases in northern Yemen. The crisis caused by increase in fuel shortages has affected several thousand children and their families.[304]

Health [ edit ]

The Yemeni civil war has often been referred to as the ""world's forgotten war"".[305][306] In 2018, the United Nations warned that 13 million Yemeni civilians face starvation in what it says could become ""the worst famine in the world in 100 years.""[307] The UN estimates that the war caused an estimated 230,000 deaths by December 2020, of which 130,000 were from indirect causes which include lack of food, health services and infrastructure.[291] Earlier estimates from 2018 from Save the Children estimated that 85,000 children have died due to starvation in the three years prior.[308]

Between October 2016 and August 2019, over 2,036,960 suspected cholera cases were reported in Yemen, including 3,716 related deaths (fatality rate of 0.18%).[309]

The seasonal flu virus in Yemen has claimed more than 270 lives since October 2019. Poor medical facilities and widespread poverty in Yemen due to the war waged by Saudi-led coalition and Houthis have led to the deaths of many infected patients in their homes.[310]

Between April and July 2020, research showed that there was a peak in daily excess burial rates of approximately 1500, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[311]

The overall disease surveillance in Yemen was also affected by the armed conflict. The disease early warning system was fragmented, with the government without control of the system in Houthis controlled areas and vice versa.[312][313]

The UN estimated that by the end of 2021, the conflict in Yemen had claimed more than 377,000 lives, and 70% of deaths were children under age 5.[126][110]

Religious minorities [ edit ]

The US government estimates that religious minorities in Yemen constitute less than 1% of the population. They are categorized into four groups including Baha’is, Jews, Christians and Hindus. The Houthi movement has been said to be intolerant towards religious minorities. It was claimed that Houthis attachement to their own practices has led to a discriminatory stance against other types of faiths present in territories that are under their control. The Baha’i International Community stated that a number of Baha’is were imprisoned by the Houthi for religious reasons.[314]

In the province of Al-Bayda, AQAP was responsible for the execution of four people on January 10, 2019. The justification given related to their atheist beliefs.[314]

As of March 2020, the Jewish Cemetery in Aden was destroyed; as of April 2020, the fate of the last 50 Jews in Yemen was reported to be unknown.[315] On 13 July 2020 it was reported that the Houthi Militia is capturing the last Jews of Yemen of the Kharif District.[316] On 16 July 2020, five Jews were allowed to leave Yemen by the Houthi, leaving 33 Jews in the country.[317] In July 2020, the Mona Relief reported on their website that as of 19 July 2020, of the Jewish population in Yemen there were only a ""handful"" of Jews in Sanaa.[318] On 29 March 2021, the Iranian-backed Houthi government deported the last remaining Yemenite Jews to Egypt, ending the continuous presence of a community that dated back to antiquity.[319]

Education [ edit ]

The civil war in Yemen severely impacted and degraded the country's education system. The number of children who are out of school increased to 1.8 million in 2015–2016 out of more than 5 million registered students, according to the 2013 statistics released by the Ministry of Education.[320] Moreover, 3600 schools are directly affected; 68 schools are occupied by armed groups, 248 schools have severe structural damage, and 270 are used to house refugees. The Yemen government has not been able to improve this situation due to limited authority and manpower.

Some of the education system's problems include: not enough financial resources to operate schools and salaries of the teachers, not enough materials to reconstruct damaged schools, and lack of machinery to print textbooks and provide school supplies. These are caused by the unstable government that cannot offer enough financial support since many schools are either damaged or used for other purposes.[321]

Despite warfare and destruction of schools, the education ministry was able to send teams to oversee primary and secondary schools' final exam in order to give students 15–16 school year certificates.[320] Currently, UNICEF is raising money to support students and fix schools damaged by armed conflicts.

Residential condition [ edit ]

The Yemeni quality of life is affected by the civil war and people have suffered enormous hardships. Although mines are banned by the government, Houthi forces placed anti-personnel mines in many parts of Yemen including Aden.[322] Thousands of civilians are injured when they accidentally step on mines; many lose their legs and injure their eyes. It is estimated that more than 500,000 mines have been laid by Houthi forces during the conflict. The pro-Hadi Yemen Army was able to remove 300,000 Houthi mines in recently captured areas, including 40,000 mines on the outskirts of Marib province, according to official sources.[323]

In addition, the nine-country coalition led by Saudi Arabia launched many airstrikes against Houthi forces; between March 2015 and December 2018 more than 4,600 civilians have been killed and much of the civilian infrastructure for goods and food production, storage, and distribution has been destroyed.[324][325] Factories have ceased production and thousands of people have lost their jobs. Due to decreased production, food, medicines, and other consumer staples have become scarce. The prices of these goods have gone up and civilians can no longer afford them for sustenance.[326]

Refugees [ edit ]

Djibouti, a small country in the Horn of Africa across the Bab-el-Mandeb strait from Yemen, has received an influx of refugees since the start of the campaign.[327][328][329] Refugees also fled from Yemen to Somalia, arriving by sea in Somaliland and Puntland starting 28 March.[330][331] On 16 April 2015, 2,695 refugees of 48 nationalities were reported to have fled to Oman in the past two weeks.[332]

According to Asyam Hafizh, an Indonesian student who was studying in Yemen, Al-Qaeda of Yemen has rescued at least 89 Indonesian civilians who were trapped in the conflict. Later on he arrived in Indonesia and he told his story to local media.[333] United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reported in August 2015 that a total of almost 100,000 people fled Yemen, especially to regional countries, like Saudi Arabia and Djibouti.[334] In September 2016, UNHCR estimated displacement of 2.4 million Yemenis within the country and 120,000 seeking asylum.[335]

In 2018, 500 refugees fleeing the civil war in Yemen came to Jeju Island, causing unease among the residents of Jeju Island.[336][337][338][339][340][341]

According to the International Organisation for Migration, despite the dangerous situation, nearly 150,000 migrants from Ethiopia arrived in Yemen in 2018, most of whom were on their way to Saudi Arabia in search of employment.[342]

In October 2019, Kuwait donated $12 million to the UNHCR to support its humanitarian programs in Yemen. Salvatore Lombardo, Chief of Staff at office of the UNHCR, said that the donation will be allocated to address the issues of Yemen's internally displaced persons (IDPs).[343]

Evacuation of foreign nationals from Yemen [ edit ]

Registration of Indian citizens evacuating from Yemen in March 2015

The Royal Saudi Navy evacuated diplomats and United Nations staff from Aden to Jeddah on 28 March 2015 as the Houthis targeted the city.[344]

Pakistan dispatched two special PIA flights to evacuate from Aden some 500 stranded Pakistanis on 29 March 2015.[345] Several UN staff members and Arab diplomats were also evacuated following the airstrikes.[346]

The Indian government responded by deploying ships and planes to Yemen to evacuate stranded Indians. India began evacuating its citizens from Aden on 2 April by sea.[347] An air evacuation of Indian nationals from Sanaa to Djibouti started on 3 April, after the Indian government obtained permission to land two Airbus A320s at the Houthi-controlled airport.[348] The Indian Armed Forces carried out rescue operation codenamed Operation Raahat and evacuated more than 4640 overseas Indians in Yemen along with 960 foreign nationals of 41 countries.[349] The Sanaa air evacuation ended on 9 April 2015 while the Aden evacuation by sea ended on 11 April 2015.[350] The United States did not undertake an evacuation of private U.S. citizens from the country,[351] but some Americans (as well as Europeans) took part in an evacuation organized by the Indian government.[352]

A Chinese missile frigate docked in Aden on 29 March to evacuate Chinese nationals.[353] The ship reportedly deployed soldiers ashore on 2 April to guard the evacuation of civilians from the city.[354] Hundreds of Chinese and other foreign nationals were safely evacuated aboard the frigate in the first operation of its kind carried out by the Chinese military.[355] The Philippines announced that 240 Filipinos that had grouped in Sanaa were evacuated across the Saudi border to Jizan, before boarding flights to Riyadh and then to Manila.[356]

The Malaysian government deployed two Royal Malaysian Air Force C-130 aircraft to evacuate their citizens from the safe airports in Djibouti and Dubai.[357] From Aden they were recuperated first by sea,[358] and there were many in Hadhramaut Governorate.[357] On 15 April, around 600 people were evacuated to Malaysia, also comprising citizens of other Southeast Asian countries such as 85 Indonesians, 9 Cambodians, 3 Thais and 2 Vietnamese.[358]

The Indonesian Air Force also sent a Boeing 737-400 and a chartered aircraft to evacuate Indonesian citizens. Indonesians remained in Tarim, Mukallah, Aden, Sanaa and Hudaydah.[359]

The Ethiopian Foreign Ministry said it would airlift its citizens out of Yemen if they requested to be evacuated.[360] There were reportedly more than 50,000 Ethiopian nationals living and working in Yemen at the outbreak of hostilities.[361] More than 3,000 Ethiopians registered to evacuate from Yemen, and as of 17 April, the Ethiopian Foreign Ministry had confirmed 200 evacuees to date.[362]

Throughout April Russian military forces evacuated more than 1,000 people of various nationalities, including primarily Russian citizens, on at least nine flights to Chkalovsky Airport, a military air base near Moscow. In early April around 900 had come from Houthi-controlled Sanaa, and the balance from Aden.[363]

The UNSC Resolution 2216 was then agreed on 14 April 2015.[364]

United Nations response [ edit ]

The United Nations has been closely following the Yemeni war since its beginning. It has looked for solutions to alleviate security concerns in Yemen and stop the Hadi-Houthi conflict from escalating. The Peace and National Partnership Agreement in 2014 was its final attempt at quelling the dispute before it transformed into a war.[137]

The United Nations representative Baroness Amos, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, said on 2 April 2015 that she was ""extremely concerned"" about the fate of civilians trapped in fierce fighting, after aid agencies reported 519 people killed and 1,700 injured in two weeks. The UN children's agency reported 62 children killed and 30 injured and also children being recruited as soldiers.[365]

Russia called for ""humanitarian pauses"" in the coalition bombing campaign, bringing the idea before the United Nations Security Council in a 4 April emergency meeting.[366] However, Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United Nations questioned whether humanitarian pauses would be the best way of delivering humanitarian assistance.[367]

On March 22, 2015, the UN declared its recognition of Hadi as the sole legitimate president and encouraged the peaceful resolution of the dispute. A few days later, Saudi Arabia intervened military with an air strike.[137]

On 14 April 2015, the United Nations Security Council adopted a resolution placing sanctions on Abdul-Malik al-Houthi and Ahmed Ali Saleh, establishing an arms embargo on the Houthis, and calling on the Houthis to withdraw from Sanaʽa and other areas they seized.[368] The Houthis condemned the UN resolution and called for mass protests.[369]

Jamal Benomar, the UN envoy to Yemen who brokered the deal that ended Ali Abdullah Saleh's presidency during the 2011–12 revolution, resigned on 15 April.[370] Mauritanian diplomat Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, formerly the head of the UN's Ebola response mission, was confirmed as the new UN Envoy to Yemen on 25 April.[371] The Panel of Experts on Yemen mandated by the Security Council, UN submitted a 329-page report to the latter's president on 26 January 2018 denouncing the UAE, the Yemeni government and the Houthis for torturing civilians in the Yemeni conflict.[372]

In December 2018, UN-sponsored talks between the Houthis and the Saudi-backed government were expected to start. The UN also started using its jets to carry wounded Houthi fighters out of the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, to Oman, paving the way for planned peace talks after nearly four years of civil war.[373]

According to United Nations, more than 3.6 million Yemenis have been displaced in the 5-year-old conflict. The World Food Programme, which feeds more than 12 million Yemenis needs more funding to continue the ongoing operations and ramp back up operations in the north. Without funding, 30 of 41 major aid programmes in Yemen would close in the next few weeks.[374]

On 27 September 2020, the United Nations announced that the Iran-backed Houthi rebels and the Hadi government supported by the Saudi-led military coalition, agreed to exchange about 1,081 detainees and prisoners related to the conflict as part of a release plan reached in early 2020. The deal stated the release of 681 rebels along with 400 Hadi government forces, which included fifteen Saudis and four Sudanese. The deal was finalized after a week-long meeting held in Glion, Switzerland, co-chaired by UN Special Envoy for Yemen, Martin Griffiths.[375] The prisoner-swap deal was done by the UN during the 2018 peace talks in Sweden which produced the Stockholm Agreement. The latter consisted of three major documents. The first one suggested the formation of a committee; the second called for the exchange of prisoners; the third aimed at creating the United Nations Mission to support the al-Hodeida Agreement (UNMHA).[137] Both parties agreed on several measures including the cease-fire in the strategic port city of Hodeida. A prisoner swap deal was made as part of the 2018 peace talks held in Sweden. However, the implementation of the plan clashed with military offensives from Houthis and the Saudi-led coalition, which aggravated the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, leaving millions suffering medical and food supply shortages.[375]

On 7 October 2022, the UN Human Rights Council adopted, without a vote, a futile resolution on Yemen that failed to establish a credible independent and impartial monitoring and accountability mechanism. The adoption came a year after the same body rejected the renewal of the mandate for the Group of Eminent Experts (GEE), an international, impartial, and independent body established by the Human Rights Council in 2017 that reported on rights violations and abuses in Yemen.[376]

Peace process [ edit ]

The Yemeni Civil War, which began in 2014, has been one of the most heavy conflicts in history, and caused a severe humanitarian crisis. In recent years, however, there have been several efforts to achieve a peaceful resolution and bringing stability to the country.[377]

One of the most important developments in the peace process was the Stockholm Agreement, which was reached in December 2018 between the conflicting parties, the government of Yemen and the Houthi rebels. This agreement focused on implementing a ceasefire in the city of Hodeida and the areas surrounding the city. The agreement also focused on the redeployment of forces, and addressing humanitarian concerns. The agreement was seen as a significant step to alleviate the suffering of the Yemeni people and for further negotiations.[378]

Subsequently, there have been multiple rounds of talks and negotiations facilitated by the United Nations. These discussions have covered a comprehensive political solution, prisoner exchanges and the establishment of a transitional government. The main goal has been to address the causes of the conflict, foster national reconciliation and restore security and stability in Yemen.[379]

Another important development in the peace process was the Riyadh Agreement, between the Yemeni government and the Southern Transitional Council (STC) in November 2019. This agreement aimed to resolve power struggles in southern Yemen by establishing a power-sharing arrangement between the two parties. It was seen as a significant step towards achieving a unified Yemen and an important component of the broader peace process.[380] While progress has been made, the road to peace in Yemen remains challenging due to ongoing clashes, political divisions and regional rivalries. Additionally, the humanitarian situation in Yemen remains dire, with millions of people in urgent need of assistance.[381]

The Wall Street Journal reported in March 2023 that Iran agreed to halt all military support to Houthis and abide by the UN arms embargo, as part of a Chinese-brokered Iran-Saudi rapprochement deal. The agreement was concluded with the objective to put pressure on Houthi militants to end the conflict through negotiated settlement; with Saudi and US officials describing the concomitant Iranian behaviour as a ""litmus test"" for the endurance of the Chinese-brokered détente. The agreement was concluded in the background of Iran's international isolation following the escalation of its nuclear program, an ongoing crackdown on Mahsa Amini protests and its support to Russian invasion of Ukraine.[382][383][384][385]

Other developments [ edit ]

Armed Houthis ransacked Al Jazeera's news bureau in Sanaʽa on 27 March 2015, amid Qatar's participation in the military intervention against the group. The Qatar-based news channel condemned the attack on its bureau.[386] On 28 March, Ali Abdullah Saleh stated neither he nor anyone in his family would run for president, despite recent campaigning by his supporters for his son Ahmed to seek the presidency. He also called on Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi to step down as president and said new elections should be held.[387]

Rumors about Saleh's whereabouts swirled during the conflict. Foreign Minister Riad Yassin, a Hadi loyalist, claimed on 4 April that Saleh left Yemen aboard a Russian aircraft evacuating foreign nationals from Sanaa International Airport.[388] Later in the month, Saleh reportedly asked the Saudi-led coalition for a ""safe exit"" for himself and his family, but the request was turned down.[389]

King Salman reshuffled the Saudi cabinet on 28 April, removing Prince Muqrin as his designated successor. The Saudi royal palace said Muqrin had asked to step down, without giving a reason, but media speculation was that Muqrin did not demonstrate sufficient support for the Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen.[390] A spokesman for Yemen's exiled government told Reuters on 29 April that the country would officially seek membership in the Gulf Cooperation Council.[391] Media reports have noted that the civil war has reached nearly all of Yemen, with one notable exception being the remote Indian Ocean archipelago of Socotra,[392] where the war spread due to the South Yemen insurgency in 2017.[393]

On 30 September 2019, Houthi rebels released 290 Yemeni prisoners in a move, stated by the United Nations as a revival of peace process, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said.[394]

In September 2020, the United Nations announced a swap of ""1081 conflict-related prisoners"" between the two opponents, including Saudi and Sudanese troops fighting for the Saudi-led coalition.[395] In October 2020, two American hostages Sandra Loli and Mikael Gidada who had been captives for 16 months, were freed by the Houthi rebels in exchange for releasing 240 former Houthi combatants in Oman.[396]

In January 2021, the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced his intentions of declaring the Houthi movement in Yemen a ""foreign terrorist organization"". Under the plan, the three leaders of the Houthis, known as Ansarallah, were to be listed as Specially Designated Global Terrorists. However, it induced a fear among the diplomats and aid groups that the move would cause issues in the peace talks and in delivering aid to the Yemen crisis.[397]

Although the United Arab Emirates had announced plans in 2019 to vacate Yemen and withdraw all its troops, the Arab nation continued to maintain its presence for strategic objectives. Reports in May 2021 revealed that the Emirates was building a mysterious airbase on Yemen's Mayun Island in the Bab el-Mandeb Strait. Satellite images revealed that the construction work to build a 1.85 km (6,070 ft) runway, along with three hangars, on the island was completed on 18 May 2021. Military officials of the Yemeni government said that the UAE was transporting military equipment, weapons and troops to Mayun Island through ships. The island was considered a strategic location for anyone who controls it, offering power for operations into the Gulf of Aden, the Red Sea and East Africa, and for easily launching airstrikes into Yemen's mainland.[398]

On 7 October 2021, Bahrain, along with Russia and other members of the UN human rights council, opposed the council's investigations into the war crimes in Yemen. The members narrowly voted to reject the Netherlands' resolution to give another two years to the independent investigators to continue the probe to monitor atrocities in the Yemen war. In the past, independent investigators concluded that potential war crimes have been committed by all sides. An ally of Bahrain, Saudi Arabia is not a voting member of the council, but rights activists said the Kingdom heavily lobbied against the resolution.[399]

On 20 March 2022, the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross reported that the Yemeni government and the Houthis agreed to release 887 detainees, following 10 days of negotiations in Switzerland. Both parties also agreed to visitation rights in detention facilities and likely more prisoner swaps in the near future. Hans Grundberg, the UN's special envoy for Yemen said that things are finally moving ""in the right direction"" toward a resolution of the conflict. This came after the recent Saudi-Iranian rapprochement mediated by China a week earlier.[400]

Environmental impact [ edit ]

Water [ edit ]

Yemen is facing one of the world's worst Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) crises. The lack of governance has left Yemen without a viable water supply. Poor sanitation and the lack of clean water has had a deteriorating effect on the health of Yemenis, which is apparent through the increasing cases of cholera in Yemen since 2015. The entire country has been affected by a water shortage and the price of drinking water has more than doubled. Drinking water has become unaffordable for most Yemenis. The problem in Yemen is widespread, thus making it difficult to prevent the problem from escalating because it is hard to supply everyone on a regular basis.

The Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa at UNICEF, Geert Cappelaere, has explained that the fuel shortages in Yemen have deepened the water and health crisis. The water pumping stations in Yemen have been jeopardized as they are quickly running out of fuel and over 3 million people are dependent on these water pumps which have been established through public networks. The ICRC has been working closely with vulnerable people where the resources are limited but aim to prevent the water crisis from worsening by buying 750,000 liters of diesel to provide clean water for people living in Yemen. Already a scarce commodity, the amount of water withdrawn from wells in 2016 reached unsustainable levels. The ICRC has also been working carefully with local authorities to provide water to 330,000 people in Aden. They have also installed wells nearby Aden to provide water to the neighborhood when they are experiencing water shortages.

Water resources have been used by both sides during the war as a tactic during the conflict. Unlike other countries in the Middle East, Yemen has no rivers to depend on for water resources. In 2017, 250,000 people of Taiz's total population of 654,330 were served by public water supply networks. As a result of the ongoing conflict NGO's have struggled to reach the sanitation facilities due to security issues. Since the aerial bombardment, Taiz has been left in a critical situation as the current water production is not sufficient for the population.

Water availability in Yemen has decreased.[401] Water scarcity with an intrinsic geographical formation in highlands and limited capital to build water infrastructures and provision service caused a catastrophic water shortage in Yemen. Aquifer recharge rates are decreasing while salt water intrusion is increasing.[402] After the civil war began in 2015, the water buckets were destroyed significantly and price of water highly increased. Storing water capacity has been demolished by war and supply chains have been occupied by military personnel, which makes the delivery of water far more difficult. In 2015, over 15 million people need healthcare and over 20 million need clean water and sanitation—an increase of 52 percent since the intervention, but the government agencies can not afford to deliver clean water to displaced Yemeni citizens.[403]

Agriculture [ edit ]

The Yemen civil war resulted in a severe lack of food and vegetation. Agricultural production in the country has suffered substantially leaving Yemen to face the threat of famine. Yemen has been since UNSC resolution 2216 was approved in April 2015,[364] under blockade by land, sea, and air which has disrupted the delivery of many foreign resources to Houthi-controlled territory. In a country where 90% of the food requirements are met through imports, this blockade has had serious consequences concerning the availability of food to its citizens.[404] It is reported that out of the population of 24 million in Yemen, everyday 13 million are going hungry and 6 million are at risk of starvation.[404] In October 2016, Robert Fisk reported that there is strong evidence suggesting that the agricultural sector in Houthi-controlled territory was being deliberately destroyed by the Saudi-led coalition, thus exacerbating the food shortage and leaving the Houthis dependent solely on imports, which are difficult to obtain in view of the blockade.[405]

World Report 2024: Yemen,2024-01-11T10:30:00-05:00,https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2024/country-chapters/yemen,"The last United Nations-brokered truce in Yemen ended in October of 2022. While there have not been significant airstrikes or major military offensives since the truce began in April 2022, the warring parties—including Houthi forces, the Yemeni government, and the Saudi- and United Arab Emirates (UAE)-led coalition—have continued to commit serious international human rights and humanitarian law violations in Yemen.

Violations include unlawful attacks that have killed civilians; restrictions on freedom of movement and humanitarian access to and from Taizz, Yemen’s third-largest city; arbitrary detentions; and forced internal displacement. Saudi border guards have carried out mass killings of Ethiopian migrants at the Yemeni border, which may amount to crimes against humanity.

Throughout the nine-year conflict in Yemen, parties to the conflict have perpetrated widespread violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law, causing extensive civilian harm. The conflict has included unlawful attacks, including likely war crimes, targeting homes, hospitals, schools, and markets, a number of which were carried out deliberately and indiscriminately. However, the parties to the conflict, powerful state allies like the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, and UN institutions have failed to hold rights violators accountable. Under customary international law, warring parties are obligated to provide “full reparation for the loss or injury caused” for their violations of international humanitarian law.

Yemen is one of the world’s largest humanitarian crises, with more than 21 million Yemenis in need of assistance and suffering from inadequate food, health care, and infrastructure. Despite this, all parties to the conflict have taken actions that have harmed civilians. The Saudi- and UAE-led coalition has attacked food, water, and health infrastructure. The Houthis have imposed an abusive siege on Taizz, and have blocked water from entering the public water network. The Yemeni government and the Houthis impose unnecessary restrictions and regulations on humanitarian organizations and aid projects, creating lengthy delays. And in Aden, the Yemeni government and the Southern Transitional Council have failed to fulfill Aden residents’ right to electricity and water.

Harms against Children in Armed Conflict

Yemen’s protracted armed conflict and humanitarian crisis severely impact children. Eleven million children in Yemen need humanitarian assistance, more than 3.1 million are internally displaced, and more than 11,200 have been killed or maimed, according to UNICEF. Parties to the conflict have attacked hospitals and schools, causing disruptions to health services and children’s education. Yemen’s laws explicitly permit corporal punishment of children in the home.

Warring parties’ attacks on water and food infrastructure and their weaponization of water have had especially harmful impacts on children. Many children have had to drop out of school to make time to travel and queue to bring water to their families.

The Houthis and the Saudi- and UAE-led coalition have committed serious violations against children throughout the war. Indiscriminate attacks have destroyed schools and hospitals and killed or injured thousands of children. Warring parties, including the Houthis and government forces, have recruited and deployed over 4,000 children in combat, according to the UN.

Landmines

Landmines and explosive remnants of war continue to be a major cause of civilian casualties. In the first quarter of 2023 alone unexploded ordinance caused 121 civilian casualties, according to the UN Mission to support the Hudaydah Agreement. On March 23, Save the Children stated that child casualties from landmines and unexploded ordinance (UXO) increased eight-fold from 2018 to 2022, and increased noticeably during the truce, highlighting the deadly legacy of the conflict. According to Save the Children, a child in Yemen was killed or injured by landmines or other UXOs every two days, on average, during 2022.

Houthi forces continue to use anti-personnel landmines in violation of the 1997 Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction, to which Yemen is a party. Houthi forces’ use of mines in areas containing objects critical for survival, including farmland, water sources, and water infrastructure, has exacerbated the humanitarian crisis and contributed to the starvation of civilians, according to Mwatana for Human Rights, an independent Yemeni organization, and Global Rights Compliance. Houthi forces have not shared any maps with mine removal authorities, violating their obligations under the Mine Convention.

Mine removal authorities have not followed the International Mine Action Standards in their removal of landmines, explosive remnants of war, and improvised explosive devices.

Arbitrary Detention, Torture, and Enforced Disappearance

All parties to the conflict, including Houthi forces, the Yemeni government, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and various UAE and Saudi-backed Yemeni armed groups have arbitrarily arrested, forcibly disappeared, tortured, and ill-treated detainees across Yemen. Hundreds of Yemenis have been detained at official and unofficial detention centers across the country.

On May 25, Houthi forces stormed a private residence in Sanaa where Yemeni Bahais were meeting, and detained and subsequently disappeared 17 people. The group was targeted solely on the basis of their religious beliefs. Eleven of the individuals remain disappeared. Houthis have systematically arrested and disappeared Bahais and forced Bahais into exile.

UAE-backed forces, in particular the Southern Transitional Council (STC), continued to arbitrarily arrest and forcibly disappear individuals and maintain at least two informal detention facilities.

While Yemen’s internationally recognized government and the Houthis released a combined 887 detainees as part of an exchange in April, many more individuals, including human rights defenders and activists, continued to be arbitrarily detained and disappeared by multiple parties to the conflict.

Blocking and Impeding Humanitarian Access

The Houthis and the Yemeni government impose unnecessary restrictions and regulations on humanitarian organizations and aid projects, creating lengthy delays. Human Rights Watch has documented many cases of aid interference and obstruction by Houthi forces, including but not limited to lengthy delays for approval of aid projects, blocking aid assessments to identify people’s needs, attempts to control aid monitoring and recipient lists to divert aid to those loyal to the authorities, and violence against aid staff and their property. The Yemeni government has impeded much needed aid through the imposition of complex bureaucratic requirements on aid agencies that have impacted millions of civilians’ ability to access it.

Civilians in the city of Taizz have been severely harmed by Houthi aid obstruction. Residents have faced a dire humanitarian crisis since 2015 when the Houthis closed off all major roads into and out of the city. The International Committee of the Red Cross stated in March 2022 that “the severity of food and water needs is dangerously acute in Taizz.” The road closures have severely restricted the flow of essential goods, including medicine and food, as well as humanitarian access into the city. In 2022, the Houthis rejected a proposal by the UN special envoy’s office to reopen the roads. Since that time, there has been little to no progress in reopening the roads and allowing greater humanitarian aid to enter the city.

Rights to Food and Water

Yemen has long been one of the most water scarce countries in the world and has a long history of food scarcity. The war has exacerbated Yemen’s existing food and water crisis. At the end of 2022, UN agencies reported that 17.8 million people in Yemen—more than half of the population—did not have access to safe drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene services, and 17 million were food insecure, with 6.1 million facing “emergency” levels of food insecurity.

According to Mwatana for Human Rights and Global Rights Compliance, the warring parties have repeatedly carried out attacks on food and water infrastructure across Yemen, including targeting farms, irrigation works, and fishing boats, in violation of the international humanitarian law prohibition on attacking, destroying, removing, or rendering useless objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population.

Droughts and floods, exacerbated by climate change, have also worsened the water crisis in Yemen. Extreme weather events have destroyed irrigation facilities, leading to the loss of agricultural livelihoods, and placed additional pressure on other water and land resources.

According to the International Rescue Committee, skyrocketing food prices in recent years have left more than half of the population in need of food assistance, while the sharp depreciation of the Yemeni rial has made imported food, cooking oil, and other necessities more expensive, and has dramatically reduced households’ purchasing power.

Women’s and Girls’ Rights

Yemeni women continue to face restrictions on their freedom of movement in areas under Houthi control, where authorities require them to be accompanied by a mahram (male relative) in order to travel. The mahram requirement bars women from traveling without a male guardian or evidence of their written approval. Increased Houthi restrictions related to the mahram requirement have prevented Yemeni women from working, especially those who must travel, according to Amnesty International. These restrictions also apply to Yemeni women working for humanitarian organizations, which has made it more difficult for them to conduct fieldwork and has impacted access to aid for Yemeni women and girls.

UN human rights experts have detailed the Houthis’ “systematic violations of women’s and girls’ rights,” including their rights to freedom of movement, freedom of expression, health, and work, as well as widespread discrimination.

In practice, women and girls in the south also face movement restrictions. Some women have reported being stopped at checkpoints when traveling without a mahram from one governorate to another in government-controlled Yemen. According to a coalition of Yemeni NGOs, hotels, particularly in cities like Aden and Taiz, prevent Yemeni women from staying unless they have a mahram. Amnesty International also reported that prison authorities across Yemen as a customary practice do not allow women to leave prison upon completion of their sentences unless they have a male guardian to accompany them on release. If their families refuse to receive them, they release them only to women’s shelters.

Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity

Yemen’s penal code prohibits same-sex relations. Article 264 punishes anal sex with 100 lashes and one year in prison if participants are not married. If married, the same article prescribes death by stoning. Article 268 punishes sex between women with up to three years in prison.

Abuses against Migrants

Saudi border guards killed at least hundreds of Ethiopian migrants and asylum seekers who tried to cross the Yemen-Saudi border between March 2022 and June 2023. If committed as part of a Saudi government policy to murder migrants, these killings, which appear to have continued, would be a crime against humanity. Human Rights Watch found that Saudi border guards have used explosive weapons to kill many migrants and shot other migrants at close range, including many women and children, in a widespread and systematic pattern of attacks. In some instances, Saudi border guards asked migrants what limb to shoot, and then shot them at close range.

Houthi forces’ role in coordinating security and facilitating access to the border for smugglers and migrants in Saada governorate, coupled with its practice of detaining and extorting migrants, amount to torture, arbitrary detention, and trafficking in persons.

Since the armed conflict began in Yemen in 2014, both the government and the Houthi armed group have detained migrants in poor conditions and exposed them to abuse.

In June the International Organization for Migration (IOM) estimated that if first-quarter 2023 trends continued more than 160,000 migrants would arrive in Yemen during the year.

Accountability

There has been virtually no accountability for violations committed by parties to the conflict. Since the UN Human Rights Council narrowly voted to end the mandate of the Group of Eminent Experts on Yemen in October 2021, there has been no independent international mechanism to monitor the human rights situation in Yemen and lay the foundation for accountability for abuses.

On July 26, over 40 civil society organizations and victim and survivor associations from Yemen launched the Yemen Declaration for Justice and Reconciliation (the Declaration), in which they set forth their common vision for achieving justice and reconciliation in post-conflict Yemen. The declaration underlined that grievances caused by the war have not been sufficiently addressed by parties to the conflict or by the international community.

Mwatana for Human Rights and Yale Law School’s Lowenstein International Human Rights Clinic found that the warring parties have failed to effectively provide reparations.

Thus far, negotiations between the Houthis and Saudi Arabia have not included discussions of accountability.

Key International Actors

On April 7, 2022, President Abdo Rabbu Mansour Hadi transferred his presidential authority to an eight-member presidential leadership council, with Yemeni politician Rashad al-Alimi serving as president of the council. The council is backed by Saudi Arabia and the UAE, while Houthi forces continued to receive support from Iran.

Arms sales to Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and other coalition members continued from Western countries including the US, the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, and others.

An internal report from the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) found serious gaps in US government oversight of how arms sold to Saudi Arabia and the UAE are being used. In September, the Washington Post found that the US Army’s Security Assistance Command had been training Saudi border guards for the past eight years in a program that concluded in July.

In February, international donors pledged US$1.2 billion to the humanitarian response, $3.1 billion less than the $4.3 billion needed for humanitarian programming.",Former Executive Director,https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/opengraph/public/media_2024/01/202312mena_yemen_wr.jpg?h=790be497&itok=4li_3D86

1990’s – After the reunification of Yemen, Ali Abdullah Saleh transitions from president of North Yemen—a post he had held since 1978—to president of the Republic of Yemen. At the same time, the Zaidi-Shia group Ansar Allah—or the Houthis—gradually gain power; the group’s rise has the tacit support of President Saleh.

1994: Civil War – Just years after the reunification of Yemen, the unintegrated armies of the north and the south face off, resulting in a brief civil war that resulted in the defeat of the southern army and shored up Yemen’s reunification.

2000 – Saleh reaches a border demarcation agreement with Saudi Arabia (Treaty of Jeddah) and seeks to disarm the Houthis, whom he had viewed previously as a useful cudgel against Saudi interference in Yemen.

2004-2010: Houthi Rebellion

Tensions run high between Saleh’s government and the Houthis—led by Hussein Badreddin al-Houthi—after Saleh’s border deal with Saudi Arabia. Al-Houthi eventually leads a rebellion against the Yemeni government in 2004.

June-September 2004 – Starting in June 2004, Saleh’s government begins arresting hundreds of Houthi members and issues a reward for Hussein Badreddin al-Houthi’s arrest. Fighting continues until al-Houthi is killed in September.

March-June 2005 – Fighting between the Houthis—now led by Hussein’s brother, Abdul-Malik al-Houthi—and government forces surges, leaving hundreds dead. Fighting ceases after the sides reach an agreement, resulting in the surrender of the Houthis’ top military commander.

2005-2006 – Sporadic clashes between the government and the Houthis continue, but in March 2006, Saleh grants amnesty to 600 Houthi fighters. Saleh goes on to win the 2006 election.

January-June 2007 – Early in 2007, the Houthi rebels and Saleh’s government again find themselves at odds. Fighting continues for five months until Abdul-Malik al-Houthi reaches a ceasefire agreement with Saleh with the help of Qatar.

April-July 2008 – The ceasefire had not turned a year-old when more fighting breaks out between the government and the rebels. By July, Ali Abdullah Saleh declares an end to the fighting in the Houthi-dominated Saada governorate.

2009-2010: Operation Scorched Earth – In August 2009, the Yemeni military launches Operation Scorched Earth to crush the Houthi rebellion in Saada. At this point, Houthi rebels begin fighting with Saudi forces in cross-border clashes. Fighting continues until, after rounds of offers and counteroffers, Saleh’s government agrees to a ceasefire with Abdul-Malik al-Houthi and the rebels in February 2010. The Yemeni military simultaneously carries out Operation Blow to the Head, a crackdown on both the rebels and al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).

September 2010 – Government forces besiege the governorate of Shabwa in southeast Yemen to root out AQAP militants.

2011: Arab Spring Reaches Yemen

January 2011 – Demonstrations calling for the end of Saleh’s 33-year rule begin. Saleh offers some concessions—promising not to seek reelection—but the protests spread. Security forces and Saleh supporters launch a crackdown that eventually leaves between 200 and 2,000 people dead.

April 2011 – Saleh’s General People’s Congress (GPC) agrees to a Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)-brokered deal to hand over power, but the president refuses to sign on. This prompts the influential Hashid tribal federation and several army commanders to back the opposition, after which clashes erupt in Sanaa.

June 2011 – Saleh is seriously injured in a bombing and travels to Saudi Arabia for medical treatment.

September 2011 – Saleh returns to the presidential palace amid renewed clashes. It is not until November 2011 that he signs a deal that has his deputy, Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi, assume power and form a unity government.

February 2012 – Hadi is sworn in for a two-year term as president after an election in which he stood unopposed.

Post-Arab Spring: Unity Government and Houthi Takeover

January 2014 – The National Dialogue Conference concludes after ten months of deliberations, agreeing to a document on which the new constitution would be based.

February 2014 – A presidential panel approves a political transition plan for Yemen that organizes the country into a federation of six regions.

August 2014 – Following two weeks of anti-government protests, President Hadi dissolves his cabinet and overturns a controversial rise in fuel prices.

September-October 2014 – The Houthis take control over most of Yemen’s capital, Sanaa. The following month the rebels seize the Red Sea port city of Hodeida.

January 2015 – After being placed under house arrest by the Houthis, Hadi resigns as president. Despite previous attempts to craft a power-sharing agreement between Hadi and the Houthis, the two had continued to clash. The Houthis later reject a draft constitution proposed by Hadi’s government.

February 2015 – The Houthis take control of the Yemeni government, a move swiftly denounced by the United Nations. President Hadi flees the presidential palace in Sanaa and escapes to Aden, where he later rescinds his resignation, declaring himself the legitimate president, and deems the Houthi takeover a “coup.”

March 2015 – The Islamic State claims its first major attacks in Yemen, setting off two suicide bombs at Shia mosques in Sanaa. The Houthis start an offensive against government forces, advancing toward southern Yemen. President Hadi flees Aden and takes refuge in Saudi Arabia. Shortly thereafter, the Houthis seize parts of Taiz.

Saudi-led Coalition and Civil War

March 2015: Operation Decisive Storm – After repeated pleas from Hadi, a Saudi-led coalition of Arab states—including the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Morocco, Jordan, Bahrain, Sudan, and Kuwait—initiates Operation Decisive Storm in support of the ousted president. The coalition launches air strikes against Houthi targets, deploys small ground forces, and imposes a naval blockade. The United States announces its intention to aid the coalition’s efforts.

April 2015: Operation Restoring Hope – The coalition declares an end to Operation Decisive Storm. Saudi Arabia announces it would move on to a phase described as Operation Restoring Hope. Despite the announcement, the Saudi-led coalition continues to bomb Houthi positions and the United States increases its arms sales for the Saudi campaign in Yemen.

April 2015 – Despite the bombing campaign, the Houthis capture the city of Ataq. After three Saudi officers die in a Houthi attack at the Saudi border, Saudi Arabia boosts its border security. The Houthi fighters also condemn a UN Security Council resolution imposing an arms embargo on the group, calling the decision an act of “aggression.”

May 2015 – Ali Abdullah Saleh had previously been accused of siding with the Houthi rebels in support of Hadi’s ouster; in May, Saleh and Yemeni forces loyal to him announce a formal alliance with the Houthis. The Saudis and Houthis agree to a five-day “humanitarian ceasefire.” US President Barack Obama convenes a GCC meeting at Camp David to resolve the crisis in Yemen, but only two states send their leaders.

August 2015 – After months of fighting with Sunni tribesmen and AQAP militants, the Houthis take control of the entire Shabwah governorate.

September 2015 – President Hadi returns to Aden after Saudi-backed government forces and those loyal to Hadi recapture the port city from Houthi forces.

April 2016 – The United Nations sponsors talks between the Hadi government and the coalition of Houthis and former President Saleh’s General People’s Congress.

October 2016-May 2017 – Both sides of the conflict allegedly break ceasefires. The United Nations and others try to broker peace talks and political resolutions. The Houthis claim responsibility for firing missiles into Saudi Arabia, including at the capital, Riyadh.

May-November 2017 – Humanitarian agencies and watchdogs decry the Yemen crisis as one of the worst humanitarian emergencies in the world. There are thousands of civilians dead and wounded, an outbreak of cholera, and a potential famine that would leave thousands on the brink of starvation.

November 2017 – Saudi Arabia intercepts a missile fired toward its airport in Riyadh and blames the Houthis, Iran, and Lebanon’s Hezbollah for escalating the war.

December 2017 – After Saleh had reversed course and sided with the Saudi-led coalition, fierce fighting in Sanaa between the Houthis and forces loyal to Saleh leaves the former president dead. The Houthis control much of northern Yemen but face stiff opposition from the Saudi-led coalition. President Hadi—whose loyalists control much of south Yemen—has called for a popular uprising against Houthi rule in the north. Saleh’s son, Ahmed Ali Saleh, has vowed revenge against the Houthis for his father’s assassination.

January 2018 – In a firefight, the Southern Transitional Council (STC), the United Arab Emirates-backed separatist movement seeking a revival of the formerly independent South Yemen, seizes control of Aden, Yemen’s main southern city and government headquarters. By March, 22 million Yemenis require humanitarian aid.

February 2018 – The United Nations appoints longtime British diplomat Martin Griffiths as Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Yemen.

March-May 2018 – Fighting escalates along Yemen’s western coast and dozens are killed in Saudi air strikes and security raids. A Saudi-led coalition drone strike kills Saleh Ali al-Sammad, president of Yemen’s Supreme Political Council, making him the most senior Houthi casualty since the coalition began its activities in 2015. International opposition to the coalition’s operations grows after an air raid kills more than 20 at a wedding party. In May, UAE forces take over the island of Socotra, occupying the airport and seaport and causing tensions with Yemeni government officials.

June-July 2018 – Yemeni President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi meets with UAE Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nayhan and, by July, the coalition launches an offensive on the port city of Hodeida.

August-October 2018 – International furor over the Saudi-led coalition’s war in Yemen grows after an air raid strikes a school bus, killing 40, mostly children. Public opinion of US support for the war effort in the United States plummets as it is reported that the bomb used in the air raid was US-supplied. In October, US resident and Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi is assassinated by Saudi agents in Istanbul, raising additional questions about US support for Riyadh’s war on Yemen. UN efforts to mediate between the Yemeni government and the Houthi rebels in Geneva, Switzerland are fruitless.

November-December 2018 – The US political establishment begins to agitate for withdrawing US support from the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen. Former Obama Administration officials—including future Secretary of State Antony Blinken, future UN Ambassador nominee Linda Thomas-Greenfield, and future National Security Advisor to President Joe Biden Jake Sullivan—sign an open letter expressing remorse for their support for the war and urging all sides to end the fighting. In December 2018, the US Senate, for the first time, votes to invoke the War Powers Resolution to force the US military to end its participation in the Yemen war.

Later that month, after UN-mediated talks, the Yemeni government and the Houthis sign the Stockholm Agreement that includes prisoner swaps, a mutual redeployment of forces away from Hodeida Port, and a committee to discuss the contested city of Taiz. The cease-fire is set to take effect on December 18. Overall, the Stockholm Agreement fails to achieve its goals and neither side agrees to withdraw from Hodeida.

January-June 2019 – Fighting continues. Houthis launch a drone attack on Al-Anad Air Base north of Aden, injuring dozens and killing the head of Yemeni intelligence. By June, the UAE unilaterally scales back its military presence in Yemen while continuing to support the STC, which had seized more power in Aden. Meanwhile, the Houthis step up efforts to attack Saudi territory, including launching missiles at oil installations and airports. Saudi and Yemeni forces capture Abu Osama al-Muhajer, leader of the so-called Islamic State-Yemen Province (IS-YP).

In Washington, Secretary of Defense James Mattis’s resignation in December 2018 takes effect in February 2019, marking an end to the Trump Administration’s efforts to engage in the Yemen peace process. In April, President Donald Trump vetoes a bipartisan congressional measure that would force the US military to end its role in the Yemen war.

July-September 2019 – The UAE announces it has completed its troop drawdown in Yemen, but by August, the STC effectively assumes control of the southern governorates of Aden, Abyan, and Shabwa. By the end of August, UAE forces conduct air raids against Yemen government forces headed to Aden to regain control.

In August, the Houthis launch “Operation Victory from God” against Saudi-led forces and the group continues to escalate its attacks on Saudi oil installations. In September, the Houthis claim to have used drones to bomb oil processing facilities in Abqaiq and Khurais in eastern Saudi Arabia. The attacks result in Saudi Arabia losing about half of its output capacity and, while the Houthis take credit for the aggression, the international community blames Iran because it was thought to have provided the technical expertise needed to carry out such attacks.

November 2019 – In an effort to end the fighting between ostensible coalition partners in southern Yemen, Saudi Arabia and the UAE broker a power-sharing agreement between their respective partners in the Yemen government forces and the STC. The Riyadh Agreement is signed in early November, but by December, clashes between the two resume.

January-February 2020 – Fighting between the Saudi-led coalition and the Houthis picks up. Houthi forces carry out missile attacks on military training camps and in Saudi Arabia’s southern provinces. They claim to “liberate” roughly 1,550 square miles of territory in the al-Jawf and Marib governorates from Saudi-led forces, a claim the coalition denies.

March 2020 – Houthi forces capture the strategic city of al-Hazm in the al-Jawf offensive and Saudi forces carry out a retaliatory air strike on Sanaa. This occurs as the United Nations urges maintaining the cease-fire during the COVID-19 pandemic to prevent its spread in Yemen.

The Trump Administration announces a freeze on $73 million in humanitarian aid to Yemen, fearing the Houthi rebels would control the assistance.

April-May 2020 – In April, Saudi Arabia initiates a unilateral two-week cease-fire to mitigate the risks of the new coronavirus pandemic. Days later, Yemen records its first known case of COVID-19. Despite the cease-fire, the Houthis and the Saudi-led coalition are accused of carrying out attacks. In the south, the STC once again demands self-rule, breaking its agreement with the national government.

June-November 2020 – In June, the Southern Transitional Council deposes the recognized government in Socotra, with government supporters decrying the move as a coup d’état. The following month, the STC says it has renounced its claim to self-rule and will return to the previously agreed-upon power-sharing structure.

In October, the warring sides in Yemen carry out the conflict’s largest prisoner swap. By November, Saudi Arabia and the Houthis have reportedly initiated back channel talks, with Saudi officials indicating their willingness to sign a cease-fire deal and end the Saudi air and sea blockade in exchange for the creation of a buffer zone between Houthi-controlled territory in Yemen and the kingdom’s borders. The Houthis later claim to have fired a missile at the coastal Saudi city of Jeddah.

December 2020 – The STC and the Hadi government formalize a new power-sharing agreement in Aden. Prime Minister Maeen Abdulmalik Saeed is reappointed as head of the Hadi government’s new cabinet, with seats going also to both the STC and Yemen’s Islah Party. Just weeks later, as the new cabinet arrives in Aden from Saudi Arabia, an attack on the airport kills at least two dozen people, but no ministers. The Hadi government, the STC, and much of the international community blame the Houthis for the attack and Saudi warplanes conduct retaliatory raids on Sanaa.

January 2021 – The Trump Administration uses the December attack to justify designating the Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization (FTO). The Houthis are still able to consolidate control over 70-80 percent of the Yemeni population and threaten Marib, a stronghold near the northeast corner of their control zone.

President Biden Takes a New Path

February 2021 – President Joe Biden announces changes to US policy toward Yemen, including revoking the Houthi FTO designation, declaring an end to US support for the Saudi-led coalition’s offensive operations in the conflict, appointing Timothy Lenderking as a special envoy for Yemen, supporting the UN-led peace process, and providing assurances to Saudi Arabia regarding the defense of its territory.

Houthi rebels launch an offensive in Marib city, the final stronghold of government forces in the north and near some of northern Yemen’s richest old fields. Marib hosts nearly one million Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), and intense clashes are expected to displace thousands more.

March 2021 – Conflict between the Hadi government and the Houthis escalates in Marib governorate. The fighting coincides with ongoing Houthi missile and drone attacks against Saudi oil facilities, airports, and airbases. Saudi Arabia retaliates with airstrikes, particularly in Sanaa. The US condemns Houthi actions. Riyadh proposes a ceasefire, which includes reopening of Hodeida seaport and Sanaa airport. Houthis reject the proposal on the grounds that a full lifting of the ongoing blockade is a prerequisite for any such agreement.

April-May 2021 – Strikes and counterstrikes continue and escalate. The UN Security Council and Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif voice their support for a ceasefire between the various Yemeni actors. In a discussion with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the US’s Lenderking pushes for the Saudi-led coalition to loosen the blockade on Hodeida and Sanaa. The Houthis refuse to meet with then-UN Special Envoy for Yemen Martin Griffiths to discuss de-escalation of the conflict.

August 2021 – Amid continued air attacks from Houthi rebels, the Biden Administration removes its most advanced missile defense systems from Saudi Arabia. The withdrawal follows a Houthi attack that wounded eight civilians on Saudi soil and damaged a commercial airliner.

The UN outgoing special envoy for Yemen announces nearly 20 million people, or two-thirds of the country’s population, are dependent on humanitarian aid for daily needs. Five million “are one step away from succumbing to famine and the diseases that go with it,” he warns.

As Houthis continue to gain ground against Hadi government forces in Marib, Oman attempts to broker a peace deal between Saudi Arabia and the Houthis. Houthi negotiators refuse to meet with the newly appointed UN Special Envoy for Yemen, Hans Grundberg, before the Saudi-led coalition commits to the full lifting of the blockade on Hodeida and Sanaa.

September 2021 – After a lull in hostilities, Houthi rebels renew their offensive in the Marib Governorate. The rebels capture Rahabeh, a key district in the south of Marib. Government forces had recaptured Rahabeh from Houthi control in July 2021. The Houthis continue to make progress in the battle for Marib city.

Government security forces forcefully respond to widespread protests across southern Yemen, killing three protesters. Yemeni people take to the streets over the collapse of Yemen’s currency and inaccessibility of basic daily necessities.

On September 18, Houthis execute nine people on charges of involvement in the Saudi-led coalition airstrike in April 2018. The strike killed Saleh Ali al-Sammad, the Houthi-aligned de facto president of Yemen.

On September 27, a US official delegation (including National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, Timothy Lenderking, and the NSC’s Coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa Brett McGurk) meet with Mohammed bin Salman and Deputy Defense Minister Khalid bin Salman to push for a diplomatic solution for the conflict.

October 2021 – The United Nations Human Rights Council votes against renewing the mandate for the Group of Eminent International and Regional Experts on Yemen (GEE), the only independent body monitoring all parties to the conflict. Saudi Arabia is accused of attempting to shut down the investigation, which in 2018 reported possible war crimes committed by all parties.

Clashes continue around Marib between Hadi government and the Houthis. On October 17, Houthis gain control of the Usaylan, Bayhan, and Ain districts of Shabwa Governate and the al-Abdiyah and Harib districts of Marib Governate.

November 2021 – Houthis seize the former premises of the US Embassy in Sanaa, detaining local employees. The United States calls for their immediate release and demands that the Houthis vacate the premises.

Houthi spokesperson announces capture of Marib’s al-Jubah and Jabal Murad districts, after last month taking al-Abdiyah and Harib. Government forces prepare to defend their last remaining northern stronghold, Marib city. Some two-million civilians are now trapped in Marib Governorate.

Coalition-aligned forces abandon their position in the port city Hodeida, allowing rebels to retake the city. A 2018 cease-fire agreement prohibited fighting between the two sides, and government forces state they are withdrawing troops from Hodeida to send them to reinforce the front lines.

December 2021 – Due to falling international funding, the World Food Program (WFP) cuts food aid to Yemen. In November 2021, WFP targeted 11.1 million for food assistance. The cost of food dramatically increases as the humanitarian situation deteriorates.

January – February 2022 – Houthi rebels launch a series of unprecedented attacks against the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, including air attacks across the border and seizing a UAE vessel in the Red Sea. The Saudi-led coalition responds with a bombing campaign in Sanaa, an attack on a northern prison, and a strike on a telecoms facility in Hodeida resulting in a four-day internet blackout across the country. UAE-backed forces regain control of areas near Marib.

On February 23, the US Treasury Department announces new sanctions against individuals involved in a funding network for the Houthis.

The United Nations Security Council renews for one year its arms embargo on Yemen, and continues a travel ban and asset freeze on actors who threaten the peace. The Council condemns Houthi attacks on Saudi Arabia and the UAE that struck civilians and civilian infrastructure. (Four countries abstain: Mexico, Ireland, Norway, and Russia).

March 2022 – On March 6, the Houthis reach an agreement with the United Nations to address the issue of an abandoned oil tanker in the Red Sea, the FSO Safer, that posed a threat of a massive oil spill.

The World Food Program declares that the humanitarian situation in Yemen is worsening because of the Russian war on Ukraine.

Houthis continue attacks against Saudi oil facilities, while the coalition continues its strikes against Sanaa and Hodeida.

GCC-sponsored talks in Riyadh begin between the various parties to the Yemen conflict. The Houthis decline to participate, stating that they should be held in a neutral country. Saudi Arabia announces on the same day the cessation of all military operations in Yemen as of March 30.

April 2022 – The UN brokered a two-month truce between warring parties that is to begin with the holy month of Ramadan. The agreement is a notable step toward peace, as the last nationwide coordinated cessation of hostilities was during peace talks in 2016.

As peace efforts gain traction with a two-month ceasefire, exiled President Abdrabbu Mansour Hadi transfers powers to a new Presidential Leadership Council. Led by Rashad al-Alimi, members of the council were selected at GCC-sponsored talks in Riyadh, and include individuals associated with the secessionist Southern Transitional Council as well as those formerly part of the government under Hadi. Hadi fires Vice President Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar, who has long been resented by the Houthis, and delegates his powers to the presidential council. After the transfer of power is announced, Saudi Arabia and the UAE say they will provide $3 billion to support Yemen’s decimated economy.

Despite the two-month truce, Houthi forces resume attacks on the front lines of the battle for Marib which have been static since February, when UAE backed forces pushed Houthis out of the center of the Hareb district.

Houthi rebels sign an “action plan” to prevent the recruitment and use of children in armed conflict. A senior Houthi military official had said in 2018 that the group inducted 18,000 child soldiers into its army, some of whom as young as 10 years old.

October 2022:

A UN-brokered ceasefire agreement lapsed, though no large-scale conflict began. The truce had produced the lowest levels of deaths from political violence seen since 2015.

March 2023:

A China-brokered détente between Iran and Saudi Arabia was finalized this month, paving the way for potential Saudi-Houthi peace talks.

April 2023:

Saudi and Omani delegations visited the capital of Sanaa to hold talks with Houthi officials. The meetings were a sign of progress in Saudi-Houthi relations, further continuing the trend of normalization in the Middle East.

A week after the talks, the Yemeni government and Houthi rebels freed 869 detainees during a three-day exchange period. Planes full of former detainees were flown between Sanaa, held by the Houthis, and Marib, a government-controlled city in the north.

August 2023:

Saudi Arabia publicly stated that it plans to grant $1.2 billion in aid to Yemen’s internationally-recognized government. These funds were to assist the country’s economy, stabilize prices, pay civil servant salaries, and balance the budget.

Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) increased the number of attacks in Yemen, reaching the highest monthly level in May and June of this year. Most of AQAP violence was directed at the Southern Transitional Council (STC) and STC-allied forces, with some of the most violent attacks occurring in August. The group’s decreasing influence has led to its increasing use of drones and IEDs.

September 2023:

A delegation of Houthi officials and Omani mediators visited Saudi Arabia for a five-day round of negotiations. This was the first official visit by Houthis to the country since 2014. The discussions included reconstruction plans, a timeline for foreign troop withdrawal from Yemen, and the reopening of the Sanaa airport and ports controlled by the Houthis. Officials were optimistic, yet no concrete agreement was drafted. Nevertheless, both parties have retained a relative truce since the UN-brokered agreement.

November 2023:

Following the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, the Houthis once again entered international headlines when the group declared war on Israel and shot down a US drone. On November 19, the Iran-funded group hijacked an Israel-linked cargo ship in the Red Sea and held 25 crew members hostage. Since then, the Houthis have continued to attack ships in the Red Sea shipping route.

December 2023:

In response to ongoing Houthi attacks against ships in the Red Sea, the US initiated Operation Prosperity Guardian along with a coalition of 20 other countries, some of which wanted to remain anonymous. Saudi Arabia is notably absent in the list of participants, with Bahrain being the only MENA country.

At the end of the month, the UN Office of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Yemen Hans Grundberg provided an update on peace talks. The office stated that there was progress in negotiations and that both parties, represented by the Presidential Leadership Council (PLC) President Rashad al-Alimi and the Houthi chief negotiator Mohammed Abdul Salam, have agreed to a set of measures for a ceasefire. Saudi Arabia and Oman were cited as playing key roles in the progress, along with the UN Special Envoy.

January 2024:

The Biden administration re-designated the Houthis as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT). The administration had de-listed the group in 2021 following a last-minute decision to list them by the Trump Administration just a month before.

February 2024:

Houthi leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi stated that the group will further escalate its attacks on Red Sea shipping if “aggression against Gaza does not stop, along with the siege of the Palestinian people from whom they deny aid and medicine.”

International support and aid funding for Yemen has decreased, and humanitarian aid deliveries to Yemen and other countries in need of assistance have been severely delayed.

Saudi Arabia gave $250 million in aid to the Yemeni government for civil servant salaries, the budget deficit, and other government expenses. This was part of the country’s plan, introduced in August 2023, to provide $1.2 billion in aid to the Yemen government.

March 2024:

The Houthis claim their first attack on cargo ships in the Indian Ocean, further expanding their reach as they continue their attacks on shipping in the Red Sea. As of March 12, the Houthis have attacked both naval and commercial vessels in regional waters over 60 times. These attacks have only increased since US-led Operation Prosperity Guardian was launched in December 2023. A peace deal is at a standstill, with talks on pause as Houthi attacks generate international outrage.

The Houthi group threatened Saudi Arabia that if it allowed US forces, specifically fighter jets, to use its territory and airspace for its Operation Prosperity Guardian, they would target it as well. Saudi Arabia has not become involved in the US-led coalition and has publicly asked the US to “show restraint” when responding to Houthi attacks.

AQAP leader Khalid Batarfi died this month from unknown causes. Saad bin Atef al-Awlaki was chosen as his successor. With new leadership and increasing instability and international focus on Yemen, experts predict a rise in AQAP recruitment and attacks.

The Ongoing War in Sudan and Its Implications for The Security and Stability of The Horn of Africa and Beyond,Published date not found (newspaper3k),https://www.policycenter.ma/publications/ongoing-war-sudan-and-its-implications-security-and-stability-horn-africa-and-beyond,"1. Introduction

Violent conflicts and civil strife are political realities in post-independence Sudan, leading the country to lose permanently its former southern territory (now South Sudan), after a referendum in 2011. Moreover, a combination of violent civil conflicts and army coup d’états has hampered attempts to transition and build democratic governance in Sudan. More than six decades after Sudan achieved its independence, the detrimental effects of conflicts and civil strife in the country remain unabated, and now pose an existential threat to state survival. The country is currently experiencing crippling and tumultuous political turmoil, marked by a fierce and bitter war that ignited on April 15, 2023, mainly between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by Abdul Fattah al-Burhan, and a paramilitary group known as the Rapid Support Force (RSF), headed by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (""Hemedti"").

The potential collapse of Sudan as a functioning state would have detrimental repercussions for not only the country and the Sudanese people, but also the wider region and beyond. The push to restore peace, order, and stability in Sudan presupposes an understanding of the ongoing conflict’s significance, impact, and implications for domestic, regional, and international peace, security, and stability.

What is behind the violent conflict between the SAF and RSF? Why has the government of Sudan (or SAF) failed to avert the dangerously consequential nationwide violence? What attempts have been made to work towards a peaceful end to the conflict? What is the regional effect of the conflict between the two warring parties? What are the implications of the ongoing conflict for the security and stability of the Horn of Africa region and beyond? This paper investigates how the country’s security architecture has been undermined by state-parallel paramilitaries, leading to full-fledged war and a humanitarian crisis of unprecedented scale, which threatens not only Sudan's stability but also poses significant risks to regional security and humanitarian conditions. It also explores the significance, prospects, challenges, and implications of the ongoing war.

2. Background to the 2023 Sudan Civil War

Sudan has faced continuous political violence and conflicts since gaining independence (Johnson, 2016). Most recently, war started on April 15, 2023, between two former allies, the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Force (RSF). This conflict arose after President Al-Bashir was removed from power by military allies on April 11, 2019, in response to a peaceful revolution against his regime (Awad, 2022; Mustasilta, 2019). There was hope for democracy and a united Sudan after a power-sharing agreement was signed on August 7, 2019, between the Transitional Military Council (TMC) and the opposition Forces of Freedom and Change (FFC) (United Nations, 2022). This agreement aimed to create a three-year transitional government ahead of democratic elections. However, Sudan’s political transition has stalled due to the inability of key political groups to agree, including the military, opposition forces, and civil society groups (Tossell, 2020). The political process was further disrupted by a military coup in 2021 and the ongoing conflict between ASF and RSF. These conflicts reflect the struggle among Sudan’s leaders, with different interests and priorities, preventing a smooth transition to democracy.

The October 25, 2021, military coup in Sudan was a major obstacle to the country’s path to democracy (Eltayeb, 2022). The military coup dissolved the post-Al-Bashir power-sharing agreement, leading to a state of emergency and the arrests of Prime Minister Hamdok and civilians. Army leader al-Burhan formed a new council without key political voices, halting democratic progress. This upheaval harmed lives and the economy, dashing hopes for democracy. However, al-Burhan agreed to civilian rule on November 21, 2021, with elections planned for July 2023. Released civilians saw Hamdok reinstated, but he resigned on January 2, 2022. These events illustrate Sudan’s democratic challenges amid military interference, unrest, and economic difficulties.

Against this background, Sudan’s security architecture during the transition process has been marred by divisions between the SAF and the paramilitary RSF. The monopoly on violence (Dusza, 1989; Krahmann, 2009; Wulf 2011) is fragmented due to a relative balance of capabilities and interests between the SAF and the paramilitary RSF. Contentious issues such as transitional justice, accountability, and security reforms, including the integration of the Rapid Support Forces, were discussed during a meeting of military and civilian leaders in November 2021 and these issues were part of a plan to return to civilian-led government by January 2023 (Reuters, 2023).

One big problem was the divide between the regular army and the RSF over integrating forces as part of the political transition process to establish a civil state in Sudan following the 2019 removal of long-ruling leader Omar al-Bashir. By April 2023, tensions had risen between these groups over merging, with accusations flying from both sides. General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (known as Hemedti), the country’s deputy and head of the RSF paramilitary group, criticized Al-Burhan for the 2021 coup, while the army warned of dangerous times ahead. The strong disagreement between the two military leaders led to fierce fighting starting on April 15, 2023, turning into a full-on war. Khartoum, the capital, became a war zone, and it rapidly spreading nationwide so the army moved its main operations to Port Sudan.

Although the failed political transition, military coup, integration, and control issues of the Rapid Support Force are among the key reasons of the current conflict in Sudan, Al-Burhan and his rival from the RSF are primarily fighting for legitimacy and support as the true leaders of Sudan (Espanol, 2024). Now, the war is not just about control of strategic cities and towns but about a struggle for leadership legitimacy between General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan of the SAF and Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (""Hemedti"") of the RSF, with each side fighting to prove their claim as the rightful leaders of Sudan. The war has continued unabated into 2024, resulting in humanitarian crisis of unprecedented scale and creating a severe food and healthcare shortage. Economically, the conflict has decimated Sudan’s economy, and soaring poverty rates Given the legacies of military rule and intrastate conflicts in Sudan, and the fact that both warring sides were evenly matched in terms of power and goals, the recent violent escalation may lead the country not only back to authoritarian rule and state fragmentation but is also affecting the neighboring countries in the region. Moreover, Sudan has become a battleground for proxy conflicts involving regional players such as Egypt, Iran, and the UAE, as external powers compete for influence and resources in the country. This geopolitical rivalry further complicates the situation, raising fears that the conflict could spill over into neighboring countries like Ethiopia and Eritrea, potentially escalating into a broader regional war. Addressing this intertwined humanitarian, economic, and security challenges is crucial for stabilizing Sudan and the greater Horn of Africa.

The conflict between the SAF and RSF since April 2023 continues to spread across Sudan, affecting the region and neighboring countries. One spillover effect is the internal displacement and cross-border flow of Sudanese seeking safety in neighboring nations. The conflict’s intensity has forced millions to flee within and outside Sudan. According to the United Nation’s World Food Program (February 2024), the conflict in Sudan has created one of the world’s largest displacement crises internally and abroad since April 2023. By September 2024, UNHCR reported 11, 277,221 million displaced, with 2,907,470 million in Chad, South Sudan, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the Central African Republic (UNHCR, September 29, 2024). The International Organization for Migration’s October 2 report estimated 10.8 million displaced, including 2.3 million in neighboring countries (IOM, October 2, 2024). On the other hand, an estimated 24.8 million people, half of the Sudanese population need humanitarian assistance (23 September 2024, OCHA). Despite UNHCR and partners providing aid to refugees, the cross-border influx to neighboring countries is straining host nations. Fragile neighboring countries also face worsened crises due to existing displacements. In addition to tens of thousands of lives lost because of the violence, this displacement—the world’s largest displacement crisis (Sen, 2023)—along with refugee flows, has caused food and healthcare shortages, stressing regional governments and aid providers.

Moreover, the war has triggered security concerns along Sudan’s borders, including with countries that are themselves grappling with active domestic armed conflicts (Office of the Director of National Intelligence, 2024). Given the current domestic instability and proliferation of armed groups in countries sharing borders with Sudan, there is increasing concern about arms trafficking or smuggling into the Amhara region of Ethiopia via the Sudanese border, as reported by Ethiopian state and non-state mainstream media outlets. This could worsen the security situation in neighboring countries, as smuggled arms might fuel and spread violence by armed groups with contending interests, further complicating the situation in Sudan as well. This could lead to the potential spread of violence and combatants across borders, potentially engulfing the entire region from Somalia in the east to the westernmost point of the continent. Although Sudan used to act as a buffer between extremist militants in Somalia in the Horn of Africa and those in the Sahel region, the ongoing war could create fertile ground for the establishment of collaboration among extremist militant groups across the east-west region of the Sahel Sahara (ibid). This suggests that this situation may create favorable conditions for the spread of violent extremism in the region, especially given Sudan’s history as a former exporter of religiously motivated violent conflicts. Not only could the spread of extremism and arms trafficking become a concern, but also the involvement of numerous non-state actors is a possibility. The likelihood of this happening is evident, as the Sudanese government’s capacity to control and manage its borders diminishes because of the ongoing war. It is apparent that activities related to transboundary organized crime, including arms smuggling, will continue to spread unless efforts are made to restore peace and government institutions in Sudan.

Furthermore, the devastating war has affected every aspect of the Sudanese economy, including the industrial, agricultural, mining, and service sectors. It has also interrupted access to basic public services, hampered access to markets, and continued to trigger considerable scarcity of life-saving goods and services (Guo et al, 2023). The more the conflict escalates and continues unabated, the more it impacts the country’s economy and people’s livelihoods. The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) has predicted that Sudan’s economy lost about $15 billion up to the end of 2023 because of the war, which is equivalent to 48% of Sudan’s GDP. This led to declines in output from the industrial, agricultural, and service sectors estimated to be 70%, 49%, and 21%, respectively, with an estimated loss of 5.2 million jobs at the end of the last fiscal year, equivalent to half of the country’s labor force (Siddig et al, 2023). The poverty rate has increased to 65.6%, which is equivalent to 28.4 million people by the end of 2023, compared to 61.1% in 2019, which was equivalent to 26.4 million people (Siddig et al, 2023). The economy is expected to continue shrinking in 2024 since the war has continued to intensify unabated. Experts at The Soufan Center (2024), a New York-based non-profit research body, have warned that the active conflict risks spilling over into neighboring countries, with a considerable possibility of growing into a wider regional conflict.

The greater Horn of Africa has been subject to the interplay of the preferences and goals of external interests and local forces, including China, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and the United States. Sudan is one of the few countries in the Horn of Africa region that has vast arable land for large-scale agriculture, with easy access to the seaport of Port Sudan. It is an investment attraction for states in the Persian Gulf region because of Sudan’s immediate eastern neighborhood. As a result, the conflict in Sudan has played into this competition for influence and access to Sudan and the subregion. Sudan has now become an arena for a regional proxy conflict for some of the competing regional powers, in which the main enablers of the two warring factions in the country are reportedly from both neighboring and Middle Eastern countries, mainly Egypt, Iran, and the UAE (International Crisis Group, 2024). Egypt and Iran are allegedly major political backers or suppliers of arms to al-Burhan’s SAF, while the UAE is considered the main political backer and supplier of weapons to Hemeti’s RSF.

Moreover, Reuters (Lewis, 2024) reported that while Chad and some tribal alliances from across Sudan’s western and southern neighboring countries of Libya and the Central African Republic back Hemeti’s RSF, the eastern neighbor Eritrea supports al-Burhan’s SAF. Ethiopia, Israel, Kenya, Saudi Arabia, and South Sudan have maintained close ties with both warring parties and, until now, have seemingly remained neutral, trying to bring both conflicting parties to terms. In addition to becoming a battleground for the proxy war of external powers from the Middle East, some neighboring countries, such as Ethiopia and Eritrea, may be dragged into Sudan’s complex conflict if the violence spreads closer to their border areas. However, until now, the countries have officially maintained their neutral stance. If Ethiopia and Eritrea are dragged into Sudan’s conflict for the above reasons or any other reason, the conflict in Sudan may transform into a regional war. Experts at The Soufan Center (2024), a New York-based non-profit research body, have warned that the active conflict risks spilling over into neighboring countries, with a considerable possibility of growing into a wider regional conflict.

Ethiopia’s neutral stance over the conflict in Sudan stems from its intention not to escalate or exacerbate the long-standing diplomatic disputes that put the country at loggerheads with Sudan and Egypt—first over the filling and operation of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, on the main tributary of the Nile River, and second, its border dispute with Sudan over the Al Fashqa triangle, which is fertile farmland. However, although Ethiopia has declared officially that it will remain neutral in the conflict in Sudan, some experts think that it is subtly allied with the UAE because of its close relations with the latter.

Since the start of the war which continues to this day, there have been multiple diplomatic tracks aimed at bringing an end to the extremely destructive conflict. These efforts have mainly focused on an immediate humanitarian ceasefire but have made minimal progress.

The East African Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), a sub-regional bloc representing the Greater Horn of Africa, of which Sudan is a member, has attempted to bring an end to the crisis in Sudan. IGAD, championed by both Djibouti and Kenya, has been calling for a face-to-face meeting of the warring parties in Sudan, but to no avail. About two months after the start of the war, IGAD adopted a roadmap for the resolution of the conflict in Sudan in its 14th Ordinary Session of the IGAD Assembly of Heads of State and Government on June 12, 2023, in Djibouti, where the IGAD headquarters is located. Accordingly, the roadmap nominates Djibouti, Ethiopia (initially not included and causing some diplomatic rift), Kenya, and South Sudan as members of the IGAD High-Level Delegation for the peace process in Sudan, with President Ruto of Kenya as chair of the Quartet countries. It called for immediate arrangement of a face-to-face meeting between Lt. Gen. Abdel Fattah Al-Burhan, the Chairperson of the Transitional Sovereignty Council of the Republic of Sudan, and Gen. Muhammad Hamdan Dagalo (widely known as Hemeti), the securing of a commitment from the leaderships of SAF and RSF to establish a humanitarian corridor, and the initiating of an inclusive political process towards a political settlement of the conflict (IGAD, 2023).

Although General al-Burhan initially opposed President Ruto’s chairmanship of IGAD’s high-level delegation, because of issues related to Kenya’s neutrality in the Sudan conflict and allegedly claiming Ruto had a business relationship with Dagalo (aka Hemeti), he later withdrew his opposition after visiting Kenya, and meeting President Ruto as part of his shuttle diplomacy to convince leaders of the need to hold an IGAD summit meeting to speed up the Jeddah talks process for a humanitarian ceasefire. Ethiopia (which al-Burhan initially avoided along with Kenya) was also part of his shuttle diplomacy during his visit to Nairobi. Initially, the African countries that al-Burhan visited were Egypt, Eritrea, and South Sudan, sidelining both Kenya and Ethiopia. African countries that al-Burhan has visited since the war broke out in Sudan include Djibouti, Egypt, Eritrea, and South Sudan.

On a request from General al-Burhan, the 41st extraordinary summit of the Horn of Africa bloc was convened on December 9, 2023, in Djibouti. General al-Burhan attended the meeting, which was his first attendance since the outbreak of the war. During the meeting, he was reportedly involved in a heated and tense discussion with some of the other leaders in attendance. The emphasis of the extraordinary summit was on specific measures to end the ongoing war. However, General al-Burhan was not comfortable with, and rejected, the final communiqué of the extraordinary meeting, on the basis that the contents of the issued document misrepresented the outcome of the summit. In contrast, Dagalo accepted the summit communiqué and expressed his willingness to meet al-Burhan anytime and place determined by IGAD. Ultimately, by the end of December 2023, these differing responses to the outcome of the IGAD summit on the part of the two warring parties led to the failure of the IGAD roadmap, in particular its plan to realize a face-to-face meeting between Dagalo and al-Burhan. Despite the stalemate between the two warring parties, which has continued into 2024, the IGAD bloc has decided to remain actively engaged in Sudan’s affairs by deciding to establish an IGAD framework comprised of respected diplomatic and political interlocutors (IGAD, 2023).

The other diplomatic effort to restore peace in Sudan is what is known as the ‘Jeddah process’, co-facilitated by Saudi Arabia and the United States, and aimed at securing a short-term ceasefire and humanitarian arrangements. Since the start of the war, two major rounds of talks (from May to June 2023, and from October to November 2023) have been held in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Towards the conclusion of the first round, the Jeddah peace process mediated by both Saudi Arabia and the U.S. succeeded in helping broker a short ceasefire agreement between the two warring parties in Sudan, to allow humanitarian help to reach the needy civilians trapped in the violent conflict. The second round of talks in Jeddah was about ceasefire, facilitating humanitarian access, and conditions for a broader peace process. During this round of talks, IGAD, was invited to participate in the talks on behalf of the African Union. During the November 7, 2023, Jeddah process meeting, the SAF and RSF committed to make efforts to facilitate increased humanitarian assistance, and to implement confidence-building measures (Joint Statement of Commitments from Jeddah Talks Between Sudanese Armed Forces and Rapid Support Force, November 7, 2023). Despite the signing of the Declaration of Commitment to Protect the Civilians of Sudan and the Agreement on a Short-Term Ceasefire and Humanitarian Arrangements by the SAF and RSF, on May 11, 2023, and May 20, 2023, respectively, the two warring parties could not keep their promises and failed to act to silence their guns. The violent conflict has continued into 2024, heralding the overall failure of the Jeddah peace talks process, which upset parties to the crisis in Sudan, prompted IGAD to revise its approach towards handling the crisis, and led the African Union to enhance its efforts to restore peace and civilian rule in Sudan. As a follow-up to the “Jeddah Process,” peace talks were jointly convened by the US and Saudi Arabia in Geneva on August 23, 2024. These talks aimed to facilitate a face-to-face meeting between the two warring leaders to sign a ceasefire and pave the way for humanitarian access. However, the discussions in Geneva ended without any visible progress due to General al Burhan’s precondition that the RSF first withdraw from the territories it captured during the war. The talks are now expected to resume at an unspecified future date.

Furthermore, the Peace and Security Council of the African Union has initiated the African Union process to bring peace in Sudan by adopting the African Union Roadmap for the Resolution of the Conflict in Sudan. The AU’s roadmap is broader in its scope as it aims to silence the guns in Sudan by implementing an inclusive, Sudanese-owned process, which would end the fighting and put Sudan on a path to a democratic, civilian-led government (AU Peace and Security Council, Communiqué of the 1156th Meeting of the Peace and Security Council, held on May 27, 2023, on the Situation in Sudan, Reference: PSC/HoSG/COMM.1156 (2023)). The AU process called on stakeholders in Sudan and the international community to commit themselves to the implementation of the roadmap. The key elements of AU Roadmap are: “i) the establishment of a coordination mechanism to ensure all efforts by the regional and global actors are harmonized and impactful; ii) an immediate, permanent, inclusive and comprehensive cessation of hostilities; iii) effective humanitarian response; iv) protection of civilians and civil infrastructure; v) Strategic role of neighboring states and the region; and vi) resumption of a credible and inclusive political transition process, that takes into account the contributory role of all Sudanese political and social actors, as well as the signatories to the Juba Peace Agreement, towards a democratic civilian-led government” (ibid, PSC/HoSG/COMM.1156 (2023)).

In constituting the African Union’s Expanded Mechanism for the Sudan Crisis, the inclusivity and transparency of the process have been important aspects. Hence, the process involves a huge number of partners, including the members of the Trilateral Mechanism AU, IGAD and UN (the Core Group under the leadership of the African Union Commission Chairperson); the quadrilateral mechanism Saudi Arabia, UAE, UK, and U.S.; the Troika (U.S., UK, and Norway), the League of Arab States and the European Union; the states bordering Sudan (Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, South Sudan, Central African Republic, Chad, and Libya), the P5 (China, France, Russia, UK, and U.S.), the A3 on the UN’s Security Council (Gabon, Ghana, and Mozambique), and Djibouti and Kenya (in their capacities as Chairs of the IGAD Roadmap) (AU Peace and Security Council, Communiqué of the 1156th Meeting of the Peace and Security Council, Held on 27 May 2023, on the Situation in Sudan, Reference: PSC/HoSG/COMM.1156 (2023)).

Despite numerous peace efforts, the two belligerent groups have remained steadfast in their pursuit of victory through military means. Despite a proliferation of consultations, meetings, statements, and communiqués, a lasting ceasefire has not been brokered, hindering the efforts of humanitarian agencies to aid the needy. Consequently, the destructive conflict and suffering of millions of people have persisted into 2024. The peace initiatives have failed mainly because of the approaches used.

One reason for the failure of various diplomatic efforts can be ascribed to initiatives attempted outside of continental and sub-regional frameworks, or mechanisms for conflict prevention and resolution in Africa - the African Peace and Security Architecture (APSA) as a long-term structural response to the peace and security challenges of the continent. It includes the African Peace and Security Council—a standing decision-making organ and component elements for the prevention, management, and resolution of conflicts (Articles 1 & 2 of the Protocol relating to the establishment of the Peace and Security Council). APSA is therefore the AU's framework for conflict prevention, management, and resolution.

Accordingly, although ensuring international peace and security is the primary responsibility within the context of the United Nations, the AU and regional mechanisms are expected to play a leading role in conflict prevention and resolution on the continent. As Kofi Annan, former UN Secretary-General, once said, “it is necessary and desirable to provide support for regional and sub-regional initiatives in Africa. Such support is necessary because the United Nations lacks the capacity, resources, and expertise to address all problems that may arise in Africa. It is desirable because wherever possible the international community should strive to complement rather than supplant African efforts to resolve Africa’s problems” (UN Doc. A/52/871 – S/1998/318).

Accordingly, peace talks should have been initiated and conducted within the framework of the African Peace and Security Structure and led primarily by the African Union. While IGAD, as a regional bloc, is part of the architecture, in Sudan's particular case and given the diverse geopolitical concerns and interests of the bloc’s members, the AU should have taken the leading role, with IGAD playing a complementary role. Moreover, non-African mediation processes and their outcomes may not align with established regional mechanisms, and their outcomes will not have a longer-term effect as they will, in one way or another, be influenced by explicit or implicit concerns and the interests of external factors that have contributed to the fragmented processes.

The other factor has to do with the ongoing crisis in Sudan, which arose from a political conflict that escalated into war. This implies that the root cause of the crisis is political. However, apart from the AU, the focus of the fragmented peace processes has been on bringing the two warring factions to the negotiating table, without due attention and consideration of stakeholders in the political process in Sudan. A temporary ceasefire can be brokered but may not be sustained because political stakeholders in Sudan will not own and support its implementation. This is simply because they have not been part of the process. The extent of inclusiveness of the peace process matters greatly for the effective implementation of a possible peace deal in Sudan.

Furthermore, some of the peace initiative processes that have been attempted are vulnerable to external interference, either directly or by proxy. Examples include the Jeddah process and the IGAD track. Sudan has a strategic location along the Red Sea, an important maritime trade route connecting Africa, the Middle East, and Asia, and moreover, is also located at the center of the hydro politics of the Nile River, with huge water resources flowing through its territory. Sudan’s vast potential for food production attracts the interest and concern not only of the neighboring countries, but also from regional and international powers. Some of the facilitators of the peace processes may have conflicts of interest as enablers or detractors of either of the belligerent groups. Hence, the probability that stakeholders in some of the peace processes would like to see a peace deal that favors their interests is high but may be detrimental to the people of Sudan and may contribute to further conflict.

The Sudan war has created a crisis of previously unseen magnitude, which is causing the nation to drift to the verge of disintegration. In addition to the stalemate in Sudan’s political transition process, and the devastating effect on tens of millions of Sudanese people, the war is dragging the country towards disaster and there is a question of effective survival of the state.

The war in Sudan also has an immense significance for peace and security in the Horn of Africa and beyond, because Sudan lies at the geostrategic cross-roads of the Horn of Africa and the Sahel region, sub-Saharan Africa, and the Middle East, bordering the Red Sea. It also shares borders with many countries, including the Central African Republic, Chad, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Libya, and South Sudan. The war threatens transboundary spillover effects across the region. Exerting every effort to stop the conflict-driven catastrophe and restore peace in Sudan is in the best interests of not only Sudan, but also of the Horn of Africa region and beyond, for the following reasons:

an increased number of people will be displaced and will cross borders seeking protection, a situation which put an immense pressure on host countries’ limited capabilities to provide protection and critical life-saving assistance, including water, food, shelter, health, and core relief items. Many of the neighboring countries were already hosting large refuge populations before the start of the war in Sudan. This situation can ultimately destabilize the already fragile region.

according to the U.S. Intelligence Community Threat Assessment (2024), the more the conflict in Sudan remains unabated, the greater the risks of the conflict spreading beyond Sudan’s borders, leading to regional instability, especially coupled with the internal situation in Ethiopia (Sudan’s eastern neighbor), which is currently undergoing multiple, simultaneous, and internal conflicts, and heightening ethnic tension s (Office of the Director of National Intelligence, 2024)

Sudan is where the two tributaries of the Nile River—the White Nile and the Blue Nile—meet to form the proper Nile River before the it crosses the Sudanese-Egyptian border. Sudan is important in terms of the hydro-politics of the Nile. The instability of the country is a major obstacle to a peaceful resolution of the current diplomatic stalemate among Egypt, Ethiopia, and Sudan over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, being built across the Blue Nile, with longer-term implications for regional and international peace and security.

Sudan is also located along the Red Sea, one of the major maritime trades routes the world, connecting Africa, Asia, and Europe. The continued violence in Sudan may obstruct this important maritime passage and disrupt the movement of goods between Europe and Asia, and specifically the global maritime oil trade, endangering global energy security.

a continued conflict in Sudan means the export of crude oil from South Sudan, conducted through the Greater Nile Oil Pipeline installed across Sudan to Port Sudan, will be disrupted or remain uncertain, affecting the economy of South Sudan, and energy supply of importing countries, including Italy, China, and Malaysia.

the instability of Sudan makes it a fertile ground for jihadist groups in the Horn of Africa and the Sahel (such as al-Shabab in Somalia and Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb ) to establish networks and coordinate their operations across porous borders. Given Sudan’s history in the 1990s of hosting and giving sanctuary to Osama Bin Laden, the founder of Al-Qaeda, coupled with its important geographical location and weak border management and surveillance, the conflict in Sudan will undermine the efforts that have been made by regional and international actors to address the perilous activities of jihadist militants in the above-mentioned geopolitical sub-regions.

increased cross-border movement and diminished border control because of the conflict in Sudan, will create favorable conditions for the spread of organized transboundary crime, including smuggling of small arms and light weapons, drug smuggling, human trafficking, and money laundering, which may have a spillover effect across the Horn of Africa and the Sahel-Sahara regions.

the conflict in Sudan could turn into a proxy war given the competition and rivalry between international and regional powers for influence and access in the Horn of Africa region. Some of the external actors may become involved and support either of the two warring sides in the Sudan conflict, which would potentially complicate peacemaking in the country.

The prospects for peace and security in Sudan and its impact on the Horn region depend on whether the African Union, within the framework of its conflict prevention and resolution mechanism, can effectively spearhead and consolidate the stalled peace initiatives into an all-inclusive AU process, in collaboration with international (such as UN) and sub-regional (such as IGAD) partners, and Sudan’s multilateral and bilateral stakeholders. To what extent the people of Sudan own the process and play a leading role in solving their problem also depends on the enabling environment that would be created by the African Union. From the perspective of trust, the parties to the Sudan conflict will be more comfortable with a process under the auspices of the African Union rather than IGAD, in which sub-regional geopolitical rivalries and animosities are evident. If the multiple peace processes are to continue, the possibility of achieving peaceful resolution to the conflict in Sudan remains bleak.

On the other hand, because of the influence of numerous geopolitically significant factors, the Horn of Africa has increasingly become a stage for international and regional competition and rivalry over strategic interests and concerns. This trend has fostered rivalry and strained relations among international and regional powers, gradually turning the region into one of the world’s most militarized areas, with the potential for diplomatic and military confrontations, directly or by proxy, undermining any peace initiative implemented by the African Union or UN. In the context of Sudan, there might be the possibility that some external powers provide supplies to the two belligerent groups, or any other potential would-be party to the conflict, which will potentially complicate any future peace process in the country.

Civil War in Sudan,Published date not found (newspaper3k),https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/power-struggle-sudan,"As the civil war enters its third year, Sudan’s two warring factions remain locked in a deadly power struggle. Death toll estimates vary widely, with the former U.S. envoy for Sudan suggesting as many as one hundred and fifty thousand people have been killed since the conflict began on April 15, 2023. More than fourteen million have been displaced, giving rise to the worst displacement crisis in the world. Nearly three million displaced Sudanese have fled to unstable areas in Chad, Ethiopia, and South Sudan, overrunning refugee camps. The UN continues to plead for more support as more than thirty million need humanitarian assistance, and deteriorating food security risks are triggering the “world’s largest hunger crisis.”

Meanwhile, mediation efforts have failed to produce results as the leaders of the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and Rapid Support Forces (RSF) refuse to halt their violence, and regional and international actors have taken sides in the war. As conditions deteriorate, the World Food Programme’s Carl Skau warned, “we are running out of time.”

Background

For the first half of the twentieth century, Sudan was a joint protectorate of Egypt and the United Kingdom, known as the Anglo-Egyptian Condominium. Egypt and the United Kingdom signed a treaty relinquishing sovereignty to the independent Republic of Sudan in 1956. The stark internal divide between the country’s wealthier northern region, which was majority Arab and Muslim, and its less-developed southern region, which was majority Christian or animist, sparked two civil wars, the second of which would see the country split into two states in 2011. The second Sudanese civil war from 1983 to 2005 killed an estimated two million people, with widespread documentation of famine and atrocities. In July 2011, Sudan’s southern territory seceded and formed a new state: the Republic of South Sudan.

The dictatorship of Omar al-Bashir defined Sudan’s post-colonial period. Bashir seized power in a 1989 coup after serving in the Egyptian military during condominium rule and later as an officer in the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF). As president, he oversaw the Second Sudanese Civil War, the secession of South Sudan, and the conflict in Darfur. The Darfur war, which broke out in 2003, was later condemned by the International Criminal Court (ICC) as a genocide targeting non-Arab populations, including the Fur, Zaghawa, and Masalit peoples in western Sudan. During his regime, Bashir enforced a strict interpretation of sharia, employed private militias and morality police to enforce his decrees, and persecuted Christianity, Sunni apostasy, Shiism, and other minority religious activities. Bashir’s regime survived until 2019. By the final decade of his presidency, Bashir faced increasing popular protests calling for democracy, access to essential services, and a new system of governance. The revolution culminated in an April 2019 coup, which was carried out jointly by the SAF—led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan—and the Rapid Security Forces (RSF), a militia led by Mohamed Hamdan “Hemedti” Dagalo.

The RSF is the most powerful paramilitary group to emerge from the Bashir era. The RSF evolved from the Janjaweed militia, an Arab-majority armed group funded by Bashir to suppress southern Sudanese rebels and fight in the Darfur War. The group committed brutal attacks and crimes across the Darfur region, including mass displacement, sexual violence, and kidnapping. The first two years of the conflict in Darfur claimed over two hundred thousand lives, with over one hundred thousand more since 2005.

With Bashir’s support, the loosely coordinated Janjaweed was formally organized under the RSF banner in 2013. Since then, the RSF has been employed as a border guard force, a source of mercenaries for the Saudi coalition in the Yemeni war, and a hired security force to repress popular uprisings. RSF leader Hemedti became one of Sudan’s wealthiest men by seizing control of gold mines.

Before 2019, Bashir hired the RSF to protect him from coups and assassination attempts. Despite this, the RSF ultimately joined forces with the SAF in the 2019 coup to oust Bashir and establish a transitional government and a new constitution. Burhan led the Transitional Sovereignty Council with Hemedti as his deputy, alongside other military leaders and several civilians.

Among the civilian members, the council chose Abdalla Hamdok, an economist and development expert, as prime minister. During his brief tenure, he attempted to mitigate Sudan’s extreme economic turmoil and project stability to the outside world. However, the SAF and RSF orchestrated a coup against Hamdok in October 2021 and suspended the constitution. In response, international institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund paused badly needed debt relief and other aid to Sudan. Mass demonstrations demanding a return to civilian control intensified in Khartoum.

Hamdok was briefly reinstated as prime minister in November 2021 after agreeing to concede certain governing powers to Burhan and Hemedti. However, he ultimately resigned in January 2022, as Sudanese protestors were dissatisfied with the terms of his reinstatement and the violent actions of security forces, who had repeatedly beaten and killed protestors. Since Hamdok’s resignation, Sudan has had no effective civilian leadership, with Burhan operating as de facto head of state. By early 2022, Burhan and Hemedti were left at the helm of the government, with the power to direct its democratic transition.

Negotiations throughout 2022 over the future of Sudanese governance culminated in a December 2022 deal laying the groundwork for a two-year transition to civilian leadership and national elections. Many citizens rejected the plan due to the contested time frame, the security sector retaining some post-transition state powers, and the failure to hold Burhan, Hemedti, and other security sector figures accountable for violence. Unrest broke out again and persisted from December into the spring, leading to more violent crackdowns on protestors.

Major sticking points emerged as the transitional government began to negotiate a plan. Foremost was the role of Hemedti and the RSF; the agreement elevated Hemedti to Burhan’s equal, promoting him from general’s deputy. The deal also called for the eventual integration of the RSF into Sudan’s legitimate armed forces under civilian leadership. However, the deal did not specify a deadline for the RSF’s integration into the SAF due to disagreement between Burhan and Hemedti. The two leaders missed an early 2023 deadline to determine conditions for the agreement’s implementation, indicating tension over the RSF-SAF relationship and the future of both forces as subordinates of an elected government.

As the months passed, the power struggle between Burhan’s SAF and Hemedti’s RSF continued to stall the country’s transition efforts. By early April, SAF troops lined the streets of Khartoum, and RSF soldiers were deployed throughout Sudan. On April 15, a series of explosions shook Khartoum, along with heavy gunfire. SAF and RSF leadership both accused each other of firing first. The involvement of the Wagner Group and foreign military influence, notably from the United Arab Emirates (UAE), has deepened the rivalry at the core of Sudan’s crisis.

The fighting in Khartoum has persisted, and incidents of violence across the country continued to rise, including in Darfur. The assassination of West Darfur’s governor Khamis Abakar in June 2023, likely by RSF militants, marked an escalation; Abakar had accused the RSF of renewed genocidal attacks against minorities in Darfur. In June 2024, an NGO report stated that over 235 fires had been set in villages across Sudan, with a majority set by militias in Darfur, since fighting erupted in mid-April 2023.

Several NGOs, including Human Rights Watch, have documented evidence of numerous mass atrocities committed throughout the conflict, prompting accusations of ethnic cleansing and war crimes. In early November, RSF forces and allied militias killed more than 800 people in a multi-day rampage in Ardamata, a town in western Darfur. This attack reflected a new surge of ethnically driven killings targeting the Masalit in West Darfur. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNCHR) Filippo Grandi warned that current violence is emblematic of the U.S.-recognized genocide in Darfur that killed an estimated 300,000 people between 2003 and 2005. A statement made by the UN in January indicated that between ten thousand and fifteen thousand people were killed in 2023 due to ethnic violence by the RSF and its allies in West Darfur. In April 2024, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield highlighted evidence indicating that women and girls as young as fourteen years old have been victims of sexual violence perpetrated by the RSF.

Humanitarian access remains a crucial concern for many international actors, including the United States, which called on the UN Security Council to authorize aid deliveries through Chad. Conditions in the country were already poor before April 2023 and have worsened since. Over six hundred people died in the first month of fighting, and attacks have destroyed hospitals and other vital infrastructure. In August 2023, the United Nations stated that the conflict in Sudan was “spiraling out of control” as refugees continued to flee the country and the health system collapsed, raising fears of disease outbreaks. The displacement crisis is especially concerning given the instability of its bordering countries. In consequence, the UN Humanitarian and Emergency Relief chief dubbed Sudan “one of the worst humanitarian nightmares in recent history.”

On March 8, 2024, the UN Security Council (UNSC) passed a resolution calling for an immediate cessation of violence in Sudan. A few days later, the SAF agreed to indirect negotiations with the RSF, mediated by Libya and Turkey. However, the talks broke down on March 11 after a top SAF general rejected the proposal for a ceasefire unless RSF forces withdrew from civilian sites. The statement came after the SAF made significant advances toward recapturing Khartoum. Iranian armed drones partially contributed to the SAF’s successes.

Recent Developments

In the latter half of 2024, the SAF launched a coordinated offensive around the three metropolitan cities of Khartoum, Omdurman, and Bahri, catching RSF forces off guard. The SAF seized significant territory in the capital for the first time since the RSF took control at the onset of the war. As 2025 began, fighting in Khartoum state intensified, with the SAF retaking key areas around the capital. In January, the SAF drove RSF forces out of Omdurman, recaptured a vital oil refinery just north of Khartoum, and regained near-total control of Bahri. Additionally, in February 2025, SAF forces ended the RSF’s two-year siege of Obeid, a strategic city with railway connections to Khartoum.

In western Sudan, the RSF has continued its attacks on local rebel forces, SAF personnel, and civilians. El Fasher, the capital of North Darfur, remains the center of fighting between the SAF and its allies and the RSF. RSF targeting of non-Arab ethnic groups in Darfur has raised concerns of genocide, evidenced by the RSF attack and looting of El Fasher’s primary hospital. The humanitarian crisis in Darfur persists, with both sides accused of impeding and looting aid deliveries. The Trump administration’s decision to freeze humanitarian aid threatens to worsen malnutrition and famine in the region.

In February 2025, RSF leadership and its allies gathered in Nairobi, Kenya, to advance their plan to create a parallel government. They signed a charter outlining key aspects of a post-war government, including secularism, democracy, a decentralized structure, and a unified national army. In early March, the RSF signed a new constitution, signaling its intent to garner diplomatic leverage and legitimacy. That same month, the Sudanese government filed a complaint to the International Court of Justice, accusing the UAE of complicity in genocide due to its arms support for the RSF.",Center For Preventive Action,https://microsites-live-backend.cfr.org/cdn/ff/Um4s24YpXzkwC8EHUvtcKQZCNSL25dEoNji1DuV37ak/1689001884/public/2023-07/GettyImages-1252019770.jpg

Conflict in Sudan: A Map of Regional and International Actors,Published date not found (newspaper3k),https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/conflict-sudan-map-regional-and-international-actors,"Sudan’s civil war has attracted various foreign actors to support one side against the other. In some cases, historically known allies are divided between the main warring sides. More than ten countries in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia are known to have taken part in Sudan’s war, making it one of the region’s many proxy conflicts.

These countries are Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Qatar, Algeria, Libya, the UAE, Turkey, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Russia, China, Chad, and South Sudan. Saudi Arabia has hosted several peace talks between the two warring sides in the city of Jeddah, but it is said that Riyadh is supporting the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) in this war, contrary to its ally, the UAE, which supports the Rapid Support Forces (RSF).

Egypt, Ethiopia, Saudi Arabia, and UAE

Sudan’s African neighbors also have considerable sway over the situation. To the east, Ethiopia and Eritrea are now supporting the paramilitaries of the RSF, which recently fought alongside Ethiopia against the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), which in turn is supporting the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF). Other former rebel groups in Darfur and armed groups in eastern Sudan are fighting alongside the RSF. The head of the Beja Conference, Mussa Mohamed Ahmed, the advisor to former president Omer El-Basher, is backing the SAF. He recently just returned from Eritrea after spending months among his remaining troops and recruits; most hail from his ethnic group of El-Beja tribes.

Egypt, for historical reasons, has always supported the Sudanese army, which was founded during the British-Egyptian colonial administration more than 100 years ago. At the time, the Sudanese and the Egyptian armies were founded as one body. Now, the Egyptian air force has been accused of intervening in Sudan by the head of the Rapid Support Forces, Mohamed Hamdan Daglo Hemedti, in his latest speech on 10 October following the group’s defeat in Jabel Moyia in the province of Sennar.

The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam —fiercely opposed by Egypt—further complicated the issue. Cairo is standing with the SAF because it reportedly supports the TPLF rebels.

To the west, Chad, sharing more than 20 ethnic groups with Sudan, was accused of facilitating and delivering weapons from the United Arab Emirates using its eastern airports in the cities of Abeche and Um-Djaras, the hometown of the former president Idress Debye’ of the RSF; the two countries have denied the accusations. However, Sudanese army leaders and officials kept publicly repeating these accusations. Media reports and the United Nations have independently confirmed weapons are coming from the UAE to Sudan’s RSF.

The UAE also built a hospital in Abeche in eastern Chad for free medical services to the Sudanese refugees and Chadian people. Reports have suggested medical facilities in Eastern Chad have been used for military activities and smuggling weapons—doctors working there have told me that they have no idea about such military operations going on inside their medical facility.

South Sudan, which is entirely economically dependent on Sudan, has finally agreed with the two sides to guarantee the flow of its oil exports. Oil, which only passes through Sudan, represents about 90% of national income. The country received hundreds of thousands of Sudanese refugees fleeing the latest Khartoum war, the third after Chad and Egypt.

Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, and Iran

Russia and Ukraine paradoxically take the same sides in the war in Khartoum. Both support the SAF diplomatically and militarily. Russia continues to support Sudan’s regime as it has historically done at the UN Security Council. Ukraine’s backing of the SAF came in light of its opposition to the Wagner group, which supported the RSF before and after the war. The Wagner Group's involvement in the Ukraine conflict is evident.

A source at the army’s airbase in Omdurman, the twin city of the Sudanese capital, said that early in the war, Ukrainian teams came to their base to fix some of the fighter jets damaged by RSF weapons. The air force is the only advantage that the SAF has over the RSF, which has increased the number of its soldiers during the course of this war; its leaders alleged that they are now over a million strong.

Ukrainian and Russian fighters were seen in different parts of Sudan, both in Omdurman in government-controlled areas and Russian fighters were seen in El-Geneiana, the capital of West Darfur State.

Turkey has reportedly offered its famous Bayraktar drones to the army, and Qatar is also supporting the SAF. It is quite understandable why these two countries are backing the army, which now has Islamist factions fighting alongside it, such as the Al-Baraa Ibn Malik brigade . The former Omer El-Basher regime, which the Islamists backed, came to power in a coup and ruled for 30 years.

Iran, Sudan’s old ally, is back again after a few years of boycotting relations while El-Basher was still in power, but has since been restored by the SAF leader, Abdul Fattah Al-Burhan. Now, they are back to support the regular army, offering the Muhajir-6 drones, which helped push the RSF out from Omdurman’s strategic locations towards North Khartoum last year. Iranian elements are walking around in the stifling heat of Port Sudan hotels, Sudan’s new capital city, after the army and the sovereign council lost control of most of Khartoum at the beginning of the war last year.

Algeria has also offered fighter jets to the Sudanese army. It said that the country supports the SAF because the UAE, which supports the RSF, supports Morocco.

The impact of foreign intervention

As a result of interventions and support to Sudan’s warring parties, 11 million Sudanese people have been displaced from their homes, making it the world’s largest displacement crisis. Hundreds of thousands of civilians have been killed . Sudan is now facing the most significant famine in the world, making it currently the most catastrophic humanitarian crisis, according to the UN. The warring sides were both accused of committing ethnic cleansing and genocide, especially the RSF in West Darfur State’s El-Geniena.

Apart from the humanitarian impact, there is also a political impact; the interests of the different sides in this conflict have complicated the situation further and made any diplomatic or peaceful solution to the war more difficult.

For example, the SAF refused to participate in any talks in which the UAE was a mediator or even a supervisor, accusing the country of supporting its rivals. It also filed a complaint against that country and Chad at the UN Security Council.

The SAF has also rejected all the African initiatives to stop the war proposed by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (representing the east and horn of Africa), African Union, Kenya, Uganda, and Ethiopia after accusing them of supporting their rivals.

The RSF is more flexible in this matter. It has accepted every initiative by any country wanting to stop the war in Sudan through peaceful and diplomatic discourse, except Hemeti's last speech , in which he accused Egypt of supporting the SAF and demanded that the country stop importing Sudanese products to its northern neighbor.

People believe that the harsh position of the Sudanese army comes from its Islamist elements, who believe that they can get rid of the RSF. Unless Abu Dhabi and Riyadh agree on how to end this conflict, many see it as prolonging war. All negotiations have failed so far because different countries have different interests and agendas.

The international community’s role has been very weak. The United States facilitated a temporary ceasefire to evacuate diplomats, their families, and other foreigners living in the country but ignored the issue of the war itself. Only then did it suggest peace talks in Jeddah with the Saudis. When talks failed, the United States insisted on having peaceful humanitarian corridors to deliver the aid, which, once secured, caused the Sudan issue to fade from the spotlight.

Notably, the two US presidential candidates never mentioned Sudan in their speeches during the campaign. The Sudanese and the African people now fear the Trump administration will ignore Sudan as it did in the past.

People in Sudan and the broader Middle East and Africa believe that the international community has totally ignored them and that the US outsourced its foreign policy in the region to its allies, such as the UAE and Saudi Arabis, to deal with the urgent issues on their behalf.

Sudan’s Civil War amid a Fragmented Geopolitical Order,2025-05-22T05:05:19+00:00,https://www.visionofhumanity.org/unpacking-the-new-face-of-conflict-sudans-civil-war-amid-a-fragmented-geopolitical-order/,"As Sudan enters its third year of full-scale civil war, the conflict shows no sign of abating, with U.N. officials labelling it the largest and most devastating humanitarian crisis in the world. The war has been marked by mass displacement, worsening famine, the collapse of essential services, and widespread reported human rights abuses. 25 million Sudanese civilians, over half of its population, are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance and protection. While estimated death tolls vary significantly, the former U.S. envoy for Sudan has suggested that as many as 150,000 people have been killed since the conflict’s outbreak.

External actors have increasingly shaped the course of this conflict. What began as an internal power struggle has transformed into an international battleground driven by broader geopolitical interests. Sudan’s political instability has attracted foreign actors who seek to capitalize on the conflict to expand their influence. These dynamics exemplify the complexities of contemporary warfare, where conflicts are increasingly protracted and less responsive to traditional forms of resolution. Sudan stands as a critical test case for whether the international system can effectively address 21st-century conflicts, driven by opaque networks of regional and global actors vying for influence.

From Power Struggle to Civil War

This conflict began in April 2023 after tensions between two rival military actors, the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), escalated into armed conflict. Following the 2019 ousting of longtime authoritarian leader Omar al-Bashir, Sudan formed a fragile transitional government through a power-sharing agreement between civilian leaders and the military. However, this arrangement collapsed in 2021 after a military coup staged through an alliance between the SAF and RSF. This coup quickly devolved into a power struggle between the groups for dominance over Sudan’s political and security landscape.

The conflict has seen dramatic shifts in territorial control since its outbreak. The RSF made rapid territorial gains in the early months, seizing most of Khartoum and forcing the SAF to retreat eastward. By late 2023, the RSF controlled most of the Darfur region in Western Sudan and had seized Wad Madani, a strategic city for trade routes east of Khartoum. However, in the latter half of 2024, the SAF launched a coordinated offensive and began to counter the RSF’s stronghold. In January 2025, the SAF recaptured Wad Madani, and in March, retook control of the capital, Khartoum. Despite territorial losses, the RSF has demonstrated evolving technological capabilities. In May 2025, they launched unprecedented drone strikes against Port Sudan, Sudan’s temporary wartime capital and vital maritime gateway. The RSF has also intensified its offensive against El Fasher, one of the SAF’s last remaining bases in the Darfur region.

Throughout this conflict, both the RSF and SAF have been accused of extensive human rights violations against civilians. In Darfur, the RSF has been implicated in numerous accounts of ethnic cleansing targeting the Masalit and other non-Arab communities. Reports document systematic atrocities, including mass killings, sexual violence, and forced displacement. In February 2025, the RSF launched a large-scale ground assault on Zamzam camp near El Fasher, Sudan’s largest displacement camp that sheltered over 500,000 people. This series of attacks resulted in heavy civilian casualties and exacerbated the humanitarian crisis in the region. Both groups have also reportedly engaged in widespread killings of civilians, repeatedly obstructed humanitarian aid, and conducted deliberate attacks on civilian infrastructure.

The SAF continues to function as the de facto representative of the Sudanese state in international forums, such as the African Union and the United Nations. In contrast, the RSF originated from the Janjaweed militias during the Darfur conflict and was later integrated into the state apparatus. While both were formerly part of the official state structure, many international actors have been reluctant to recognize the latter as a legitimate state security entity. In April 2025, the RSF signed a provisional constitutional declaration to establish a parallel government structure, although this currently lacks any broader legitimacy. Most international forums have refrained from endorsing either actor, instead advocating for the restoration of civilian-led governance in Sudan.

Regional Implications and Alignments

Sudan’s conflict has become a destabilizing force throughout Northeast Africa and the broader Sahel region. As of May 2025, nearly 13 million people have been displaced, with significant spillover effects into neighbouring countries. Egypt, Chad, South Sudan, Libya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Uganda and the Central African Republic have all experienced a significant influx of refugees. These countries, already facing their own political instability and economic challenges, are now struggling to manage the increased strain on resources and essential services. The civil war has also significantly disrupted Africa’s interdependent trade routes, exacerbating economic challenges across the region. Severe funding shortages, driven by reductions in official development assistance from several countries, have significantly disrupted the availability of aid.

South Sudan has seen an influx of over a million individuals, most of whom are South Sudanese nationals who had previously sought refuge in Sudan. The South Sudanese government has received reports of the RSF operating in its northern regions and allegedly detaining military personnel. This spillover of violence is likely to heighten tensions within South Sudan, which is grappling with its own humanitarian crisis and is struggling to sustain its peace agreement. U.N. officials warn that the country is on the brink of relapsing into full-scale civil war, raising concerns about the risk of a broader regional conflict.

Regional players have provided support to either group in Sudan, with their choices shaped by a combination of long-term strategic goals, ethnic or clan ties, and security considerations. For example, Egypt has been steadfast in its support for the SAF, potentially viewing its formal organizational structure as a more reliable partner in regional negotiations, particularly regarding dialogue over the Nile. Saudi Arabia, sharing Egypt’s concern over regional stability and safeguarding its investments in Sudan, has also extended support to the SAF. Both countries have provided the SAF with significant military aid and diplomatic backing in international forums.

In contrast, Chad has been implicated in facilitating arms transfers to the RSF. While some suggest this relationship may be influenced by cross-border Arab tribal connections, Chad’s approach may also be driven by practical realities, with the RSF controlling most of Darfur along Chad’s eastern border, making them a necessary partner for managing immediate security concerns. These include preventing the spillover of violence, controlling refugee flows, and containing cross-border militant activity. The precise nature of Chad’s support remains difficult to determine.

Similarly, Khalifa Haftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA), which dominates eastern Libya, has reportedly maintained close ties with the RSF. These ties reportedly involve arms transfers, logistical coordination, and the use of Libyan air and ground bases as launching points for cargo shipments. Given their similar paramilitary structures and tribal networks, Haftar’s forces likely view the RSF as a key regional ally, reinforcing their shared goals of expanding influence and institutionalizing their power. It is documented that the RSF has also recruited fighters from Sahelian Arab tribes across Libya, Niger, Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad, and the Central African Republic, reflecting the conflict’s complex transnational dimensions.

Looking Ahead after a Year of Conflict in Sudan,2024-04-12T12:00:00,https://www.csis.org/analysis/looking-ahead-after-year-conflict-sudan,"After a year of fighting, the situation inside Sudan is desperate. More than 8 million people, half of whom are children, are currently displaced across the country and the wider region. Half the population—25 million people—is experiencing food insecurity. The productive capacity of the country, from farms to factories, has been destroyed, leaving the economy in tatters. By the United Nations’ assessment, Sudan is both the largest displacement crisis and the biggest food crisis in the world today. But even by those grim measures, the situation for Sudan’s people and the wider region is poised to get far worse as fighting extends into a second year.

Anniversaries are typically a time for looking back. But if there is to be any hope to end the bloodshed and needless suffering after a year of war in Sudan, now is the time to look forward with clear eyes about what is at stake in the country and for the region—and perhaps most importantly, what the the international community can and must do before Sudan reaches “a point of no return.”

With much of Sudan’s agricultural land destroyed or fallow as farming communities remain displaced by fighting, this year’s harvest will be Sudan’s worst in a generation. At the same time, both Sudan’s army and its rival, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia, continue to block and destroy international humanitarian assistance, respectively, that might have staved off a worst-case scenario. Save the Children, the global response charity, warns that “230,000 children, pregnant women and new mothers could die in the coming months due to hunger,” far eclipsing battlefield deaths in the conflict.

Regional Impact

The impact on the region from Sudan’s prolonged conflict is no less stark. A recent U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence assessment previewed the risks if Sudan is left on its current course, noting that “Prolonged conflict heightens the risks of conflict spreading beyond Sudan’s borders, external actors joining the fray, and civilians facing death and displacement,” which could lead Sudan to “once again become an ideal environment for terrorist and criminal networks.”

As jihadism rapidly metastasizes across the vast Sahelian region, leading to an influx of foreign fighters joining the RSF in search of a steady paycheck—a situation that is compounded by a virtual collapse of state authority to track the movement of weapons and fighters—the risks are high that Sudan could again fall prey to the country’s shadowy militant Islamist factions that once offered Osama bin Laden refuge and provided financial support to Hamas and Hezbollah.

As a function of this spiraling outlook, a geopolitical race to gain influence inside the country has broken out. Actors such as Russia and Iran are eyeing Sudan’s nearly 500 miles of Red Sea coastline and are publicly and unapologetically hoping to establish a naval foothold. Meanwhile, regional states from Egypt and Turkey to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates—all with a history of meddling in Sudan’s internal affairs—share a keen, though competing, interest in the outcome of the conflict. Whether hoping to protect a strategic investment, aiming to guarantee access to critical commodities, or taking sides in Sudan’s perennial struggle around the role of the country’s Islamist forces, these outside influences are felt differently.

But importantly for the warring parties, this great and middle power competition offers them new opportunities for advancing their own parochial objectives and prolonging the war. Playing these forces off each other, Sudan’s belligerents have succeeded in ensuring the steady flow of weapons, intelligence, and political support necessary to keep them both in the fight and, as a result, keep civilians under threat.

To be sure, those who suffer the most from this “great game” are the Sudanese people—whether through the army’s indirect aerial bombardment or the RSF’s intentional atrocity crimes. But whereas before the population might have been able to turn to a powerful coalition of Western and African states to intervene both politically and militarily to help stop the bloodshed, that is no longer the case. Indeed, this diplomatic free-for-all has only served to accelerate and accentuate the declining influence of Sudan’s traditional emergency responders: the troika of the United States, United Kingdom, and Norway, joined more recently by the European Union; and regional African states like Ethiopia, Rwanda, Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa. In previous times of crisis in Sudan, these coalitions deployed peacekeepers, forced open humanitarian corridors, and pressured warring sides into peace processes that they convened. Today, none of that is happening, and the results are catastrophic.

Worsening War

Many outside observers have termed the conflict a “stalemate” with neither side able to deliver a knockout blow to claim “total victory.” But such assessments gloss over the dynamism of the conflict and its political ramifications. After a months-long campaign last year that saw the RSF extend its control from the western reaches of Darfur to a near total occupation of the capital, the RSF began a new campaign threatening areas south and east of Khartoum along the Nile. Its easy capture last December of Wad Madani, a cultural and agricultural capital, as well as territories along the Nile, sent shockwaves through Sudan’s military leadership, which was humiliated by the loss. Similarly, panic set in among civilians living in military-controlled areas who began to doubt the army’s ability, and even interest, in protecting them. Thousands of civilians joined hastily organized popular defense militias to fend off further RSF assaults.

Since that time, the Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) has used this crisis of confidence to mobilize an effort to begin clawing back its lost territory—and reputation—and seize the momentum spurred by the threat of an outright RSF victory. Weapons deliveries, including Mohajer-6 armed drones from Iran, have helped the SAF overcome its operational deficiencies at just the right time. The army’s recapture of the city of Omdurman last month and mounting efforts to retake Gezira State have seemingly swung the battlefield momentum, if not the upper hand, back to the military—for now.

But the war is far from over and is in fact likely to get worse as the operational tempo yet again increases and new fighters are introduced. Impending battles over Wad Madani and the Darfuri capital of El Fasher are likely to unleash substantial new civilian casualties and displacements—perhaps the worst of the war so far. The arrival of new foreign fighters swelling the RSF ranks, as well as the recent announcements from Darfuri armed groups, such as the Sudan Liberation Army and the Justice and Equality Movement, that they were joining the fight on the side of the SAF, are likely to ignite the war in even more places.

Anticipating a worsening situation for civilians, Washington is again advocating for a return to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, to reconvene ceasefire talks later this month. It is also warning the two sides against expanding the war into new areas. Despite the recent naming of an active new U.S. special envoy for Sudan, after a year of uncoordinated and ad hoc diplomatic efforts, Washington is coming late to the influence game and its exhortations are seemingly falling on deaf ears.

In the absence of a coordinated diplomatic approach, or the threat of any real consequences for the civilian harm they are causing, the parties are now dictating their own terms for what eventual outcome they might accept. The SAF’s deputy commander, Yasser al-Atta, last month refused to ever again share power with civilian leaders like under the previous transitional government, agreeing only to relinquish control to an elected government—an outcome at best years in the making. The army’s maximalist position comes in response to what military officials view as collusion between the RSF and a coalition of political and civil society actors, including the former prime minister Abdalla Hamdok, to paint them as simply an extension of the former Islamist regime of Omar al-Bashir.

However, brimming with new, and perhaps misplaced, confidence that it has the necessary external support and now the battlefield momentum to win the war, the SAF appears increasingly unwilling to concede anything to its opponents—or the international community. A proposed Ramadan ceasefire last month, the only time the UN Security Council has been able to muster a coordinated response since the conflict began, was quickly dismissed by the belligerents. Meanwhile, a barrage of new aerial bombardments by both sides has begun, marking perhaps a stepped-up phase of the war, but still not one that will deliver the “total victory” that either side is hoping for.

Most likely, and perhaps most worrisome, one could imagine that if Sudan’s army was successful in taking back control over Sudan’s capital, Khartoum, along with several other strategic and politically significant cities, like the breadbasket of Wad Madani and the transport hub of El-Obeid, it might be content to reassert its authority over a rump Sudan and simply leave the “less desirable” periphery in Darfur to the tribal rule of the RSF militia.

Such a scenario already exists to the north in Libya but is by no means ideal. With gold revenue from Darfur and cross-border alliances in neighboring Chad, the Central African Republic, and Libya, even a weakened RSF with control of Darfur would retain the wealth and supply networks to remain a threat to the people of Sudan and the region for years to come.

The Road Ahead

This grim outlook of a Sudan that is physically and politically divided, economically devastated, and a net exporter of instability and migrants only grows more likely as the fighting is sustained. Now, the Biden administration recognizes this scenario is not just merely a threat to vital U.S. interests but also to “those that have been supporting one side or the other [who] are realizing they've made a mistake—that, in fact, they've really created a situation where nobody is going to win from a failed state, ” according to the U.S. special envoy. The question is whether these greater and middle countries can find the common cause required to get the belligerents to understand this as well.

On the one-year anniversary of fighting, the prospects for a speedy resolution to the conflict look bleak. Bleaker still is the humanitarian toll the underfunded international response and expanding conflict is having on civilians. Urgent action is required to arrest the country’s freefall and avoid a skyrocketing death count from the dual threat of famine and fighting.

A French-EU humanitarian summit for donor nations to sound the alarm around the disastrous conditions for Sudanese civilians is a late, but necessary step to raising something more than the paltry 5 percent of funds that have been raised to meet the United Nations’ appeal for Sudan. But even if substantial new funds are raised for the humanitarian response, it will count for nothing if that assistance is stuck at Sudan’s ports and border crossings because of fighting that continues to engulf the country.

For that reason, a similar summit must also be convened to address the state of the conflict and its external drivers. Importantly, such diplomatic talks must include those many great and middle powers: friends, neighbors, and opponents alike, whose interests are affected by the result of the war and who are already taking actions, directly and indirectly, to shape an outcome to their liking. A shared understanding that the likely outcome of a failed or divided state in the heart of the Horn of Africa, sitting astride the Red Sea, is in no one’s long-term interest must first be established even before seeking to engage the parties.

While Washington’s leverage may have waned, its sanctions faltered, and its high-level interest become distracted, it still has the power to convene and convince. Now is the moment to use that influence to assemble a diplomatic coalition to help freeze the conflict where it is—cutting off new inflows of weapons and sending a message that the only way forward is through talks. Neither party is likely to respond to outside pressure initially, and each could well ignore it entirely if dedicated efforts are not taken to shut off the spigot from the most malign actors like Russia and Iran, who operate most often outside the international system. But at this stage, the conflict cannot be sustained at its current level without steady resupply.

The road out of Sudan’s conflict is going to be long, and prospects for things like civilian rule and democratic elections are today more of a distraction than a serious aspiration. Regrettably, on the one-year anniversary of the conflict, goals must be substantially more modest: slowing the pace of war, choking off weapons supplies, raising humanitarian resources, accessing desperate populations, saving lives, and avoiding a worst-case scenario for Sudan. However, achieving these objectives creates the time and the space for the harder conversations to be broached around ending the war, establishing new transitional rule, and rebuilding. The international community must believe that it can begin that conversation before another year has passed.

Myanmar civil war (2021–present),Published date not found (newspaper3k),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar_civil_war_(2021%E2%80%93present),"Ongoing armed conflict in southeast Asia

This article is about the ongoing civil war. For the nonviolent protests, see Myanmar protests (2021–present)

The Myanmar civil war (Burmese: မြန်မာ့ပြည်တွင်းစစ်),[o] also known as the Burmese civil war, is an ongoing civil war since 2021. It began following Myanmar's long-running insurgencies, which escalated significantly in response to the 2021 coup d'état and the subsequent violent crackdown on anti-coup protests.[33][34] The exiled National Unity Government (NUG) and major ethnic armed organisations repudiated the 2008 Constitution and called instead for a democratic federal state.[35] Besides engaging this alliance, the ruling government of the State Administration Council (SAC), also contends with other anti-SAC forces in areas under its control.[36] The insurgents are apportioned into hundreds of armed groups scattered across the country.[37]

As of March 2023 the United Nations estimated that since the coup in February 2021, 17.6 million people in Myanmar required humanitarian assistance, while 1.6 million were internally displaced, and over 55,000 civilian buildings had been destroyed.[38] The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) said that over 40,000 people had fled into neighboring countries, such as Bangladesh, India and Thailand.[39]

As of October 2023, Myanmar's military, the Tatmadaw, controlled under 40% of the country, although they maintained that they controlled around two-thirds of the country's 330 townships.[40][41][42] In the second half of 2023, Chinland Defense Forces in Chin State had captured a majority of the state, with a few holdouts in urban areas and along the India–Myanmar border remaining. In October 2023, the Tatmadaw began facing manpower issues, with desertions and low morale being extremely common. This coincided with a major offensive by the People's Defense Force and Three Brotherhood Alliance in the west of the country, which was successful in taking 80 bases, 220 SAC positions and several towns by 28 November 2023.[43]

October and November 2023 saw a series of concurrent anti-SAC offensives, including Operation 1111 besieging the state capital of Loikaw and renewed conflict by anti-SAC forces in northern Rakhine and Chin states.[44][45] In Operation 1027, anti-SAC forces seized Laukkai, the capital of Kokang Self-Administered Zone, in early January 2024.[46] Northern Shan State fighting stopped with the Haigeng ceasefire after the fall of Laukkai. The Rakhine offensive, however, continued in northern Rakhine state with Mrauk U, among others, falling to the Arakan Army in February 2024.[47] As of February 2024, thousands of the SAC's soldiers have surrendered without a fight, including six generals of the Tatmadaw.[48] The SAC has used terror tactics against the population, including burnings, beheadings, mutilations, war rape, torching villages, and a massive aerial bombing campaign that has displaced nearly 3 million people.[49] The Myanmar Air Force has dropped more bombs per capita than have been dropped in the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[37] A group of observers write that the SAC's forces remain ""formidable and well-equipped"", with ""external allies and economic resources"".[50][51]

In late March 2024 anti-SAC forces in southeastern Myanmar captured Demoso and Papun,[52][53] bringing the number of district-level towns captured by anti-SAC forces up to eight. The ninth district-level town, Matupi, was captured by Chin resistance in mid June 2024.[54] In late June 2024 the Three Brotherhood Alliance restarted Operation 1027 after claiming that Tatmadaw forces had broken the ceasefire, capturing the tenth district level town, Kyaukme, by the end of the month.[55] On 17 July, two more district level towns were captured by the Brotherhood Alliance, Thandwe and Mongmit, bringing the number up to twelve.[56] On 3 August, the MNDAA as part of a wider effort from the Three Brotherhood Alliance and other resistance groups captured Lashio, the largest town in northern Shan State, as well as the headquarters of the SAC's Northeastern Command.[57] On 20 December 2024, the Arakan Army (AA) claimed to have captured the Myanmar military's Western Command headquarters in Ann, Rakhine State, marking the second regional command to fall to ethnic rebels in five months.[58]

After the deadly 2025 Myanmar earthquake, the NUG declared a two week pause on offensives,[59] and the SAC announced a ceasefire from 2 April to 22 April,[60] despite continuing airstrikes on rebel groups.[61]

Map of insurgent activity in Burma in 1948 (top) and 1953 (bottom)

Insurgencies have been ongoing in Myanmar since 1948 and have largely been ethnic-based. Communists and the Karen National Union were the primary opposition actors to the central government.[62][63] Over the 20th century, several prominent ethnic armed organizations (EAOs) rose and fell in influence and control. Larger rebel factions such as the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) formed in response to Ne Win's 1962 coup d'état and its increased political repression.[64] The 8888 Uprising, in response to the one party dominated rule of Ne Win, resulted in some of the first modern Bamar militias forming from protestors heading to areas under ethnic rebel control.[65]

In the aftermath of the 8888 Uprising the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), later known as the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), formed a Tatmadaw-led council. Myanmar's military, better known as the Tatmadaw, severely weakened ethnic insurgent groups, destroying most of their bases and strongholds through the 1990s.[66] By the time of the 2011–2015 Myanmar political reforms, the Tatmadaw had regained control of many long-time rebel strongholds including Kokang and Karen State.[67][68]

The 2008 Constitution created self-administered zones with increased autonomy as part of its reforms. In 2015, the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA) was signed between eight EAOs and the central government.[69] However, by 2018 the NCA began to fall apart, due to alleged violations of the agreement by Tatmadaw soldiers entering EAO territories to build roads.[70] Many non-signatories continued the conflict. In late 2016, four non-signatories of the NCA formed the Northern Alliance, including the KIA and Arakan Army, engaged in war with the central government and other EAOs.[71]

2021 Myanmar coup d'état and protests [ edit ]

On the morning of 1 February 2021, the Tatmadaw successfully deposed the elected Myanmar government in a coup, forming a State Administration Council. Former president Win Myint, state chancellor Aung San Suu Kyi, and several other members of the National League for Democracy were detained during the early morning of February 1. Min Aung Hlaing was installed as the Commander-in-Chief of Defense Services and de facto ruler of the nation.[72]

The established motives behind the coup are unclear. In the leadup to the coup, the Tatmadaw claimed that the 2020 general elections had 8.6 million voter irregularities, but presented no evidence. The coup may have been a way to re-establish the military's long-reigning power over the country which ended ten years prior.[73]

The bloody repression of anti-coup demonstrations led to the creation of armed groups to fight the State Administration Council (SAC). Gathered under the name of the People's Defense Force (PDF) and the orders of the National Unity Government (NUG), formed by parliamentarians in office before the coup d'état, the PDF and the NUG officially declared a ""defensive war"" against the SAC rule in September 2021.[74] The ACLED estimated that as of 29 July 2022, around 23,521 people in total had been killed in the violence following the 2021 coup.[75]

In the months following the coup, the opposition began to coalesce around the National Unity Government, which launched an offensive against the SAC. By 2022, the opposition controlled substantial, though sparsely populated, territory.[77][78][79] In many villages and towns, the SAC's attacks drove out tens of thousands of people. On the second anniversary of the coup, in February 2023, the chairman of the SAC, Min Aung Hlaing, admitted to losing stable control over ""more than a third"" of townships. Independent observers note the real number is likely far higher, with as few as 72 out of 330 townships remaining under the control of the Tatmadaw, the military forces aligned with the junta. However, the townships under the control of the SAC still included all major population centres.[80]

Prelude [ edit ]

Armed protesters [ edit ]

By late March 2021, dozens of protesters had travelled to Myanmar's border areas to enlist in and train under one of the country's many insurgent groups,[81] elevating the risk of a countrywide civil war.[82] The Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH) also proposed the formation of a ""Federal Armed Force"" to combat the military,[83] and in late March the Arakan Army (AA) threatened to end its ceasefire with the military should the latter ""persist in massacring civilians"".[84]

During late March, protesters increasingly began arming themselves with homemade weapons in an attempt to defend themselves against attacks by the military. Clashes with soldiers and IED attacks against administrative buildings and police stations became more common and protesters slowly became armed resistance.[85]

After about thirty years of dormancy, the People's Liberation Army (PLA), the armed wing of the Communist Party of Burma (CPB), became active again on 15 March 2021 when communist fighters crossed from China into Kachin State where the Kachin Independence Army would provide them weapons.[86] and by August 2021, the CPB established a new armed wing to fight against the SAC.[87] Over the next two years, the PLA would grow its presence in Tanintharyi Region, where they fight alongside the PDF, claiming to have 1,000 active troops in December 2023.[88]

Renewed ethnic conflict [ edit ]

The unrest across the nation and the increased need for SAC troops in previously peaceful urban areas strengthened EAOs. The Kachin Independence Army had already been on the offensive since February and seized the military's base of Alaw Bum near the town of Laiza on 25 March 2021.[89] The next day, the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA) attacked a military base, killing 10 SAC soldiers and taking others hostage in their first attack since the protests began.[90] The following day saw the 2021 Kalay clashes where protestors openly used homemade weapons against soldiers for the first time, targeting security forces attacking a protest camp.[91]

SAC declared that it would cease all military operations on 29 March 2021 and hold bilateral negotiations with ethnic armed groups. However, the Kachin Independence Army continued its offensives, stating that the Myanmar Army had not in fact ceased operations.[89] Seven insurgent groups who were signatories to the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement aligned themselves with the National Unity Government (NUG), including the All Burma Student Democratic Front (ABSDF) and the Karen National Union (KNU).[92] The Northern Alliance, comprising the Arakan Army, the Ta'ang National Liberation Army and the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, attacked a police station in Naungmon, Shan State, killing at least 10 police officers and indicating their disregard of the SAC's call for a ceasefire.[93] In response, on 11 April 2021, the junta military launched a counter-attack to recapture the Alaw Bum base using airstrikes and ground troops, but had to retreat amidst heavy casualties.[94]

On 26 April, the Battle of Mindat became one of the first large-scale conflicts arising from the 2021 coup. The Chinland Defense Force (CDF) began armed resistance in Mindat, Chin State and the SAC declared martial law.[95] After a soldier allegedly fired at protestors, fighting between the two sides erupted.[96] The battle lasted four days, killing 30 SAC soldiers and left Mindat abandoned as more than 10,000 people fled the area.[97]

Timeline [ edit ]

Onset of formal resistance and war (May 2021 – August 2021) [ edit ]

On 16 April 2021, pro-democracy politician Min Ko Naing announced the formation of the National Unity Government, with members of ethnic minority groups in senior roles. As part of the announcement he said that ousted leaders Aung San Suu Kyi and Win Myint would retain their positions and asked the international community to recognize their government over the SAC.[98][99] Throughout April, informal clashes with protestors intensified, such as in Taze when protesters fought back against soldiers with hunting rifles and firebombs on 8 April.[100]

The National Unity Government then declared the formation of an armed wing, the People's Defence Force (PDF) – on 5 May 2021, a date that is often cited as the start of the civil war. The PDF was formed to protect its supporters from SAC attacks and as a first step towards a Federal Union Army.[101] The PDF clashed with the Tatmadaw in the town of Muse on 23 May, killing at least 13 members of Myanmar's security forces.[102]

The Karen National Liberation Army attacked the SAC base on June 14, 2021.

In early June, fighting erupted in Myawaddy District where the military and Karen Border Guard Forces battled against a combined Karen and PDF force, leaving dozens of SAC troops killed.[103] Members of the Karenni PDF in Kayah State also captured and destroyed several Tatmadaw outposts near the state capital, Loikaw.[104] Towards the end of May, the Tatmadaw used artillery and helicopters to strike PDF positions in Loikaw and Demoso.[105] On 30 May, the KIA joined the PDF in a battle against SAC troops in Katha Township, killing eight SAC soldiers. Fighting also sprouted up in other Kachin State townships, including Putao, Hpakant and Momauk.[106]

While there were fewer conflict deaths between May and September, there were still many armed clashes and a spike in early June.[107] Two dozen local officials appointed by the military were assassinated throughout the month of June with hundreds of bombings at police stations, banks and government offices.[108] On 22 June, SAC forces using armoured vehicles raided a safehouse of the PDF in Mandalay, detaining several fighters.[109] Myanmar security forces killed at least 25 people in another raid in Tabayin.[110] These attacks occurred in Central Myanmar, also known as Anya, an area that had rarely seen armed violence in recent times.[111] On 2 July, troops assaulted several villages in Sagaing Region and reportedly killed 41 civilians. The Washington Post described how Myanmar was sliding toward ""bloody anarchy"".[108]

Declaration of war [ edit ]

On 7 September 2021, the NUG declared a state of emergency across the nation and launched what they called the ""people's defensive war"" against the SAC.[112][113] The declaration of war increased the number of skirmishes and clashes between PDF militias, EAOs and the SAC across the country.[114] According to the NUG in September 2021, over 1,700 SAC soldiers had been killed and 630 wounded in fighting during the preceding three months.[115] Several major clashes took place from September to October in Chin State, Sagaing Region, Magwe Region, Kayah State and Shan State.[116][117]

On 18 September, the Pa-O National Army, a pro-SAC militia active in the Pa-O Self-Administered Zone, aided the SAC in capturing a resistance base near Aungban.[118]

By late September 2021, 8,000 residents of Thantlang town, Chin state, fled to Mizoram, India after their houses were set ablaze by the SAC army.[119] Ambushes by anti-SAC forces in Shan State also killed at least 20 soldiers.[120] On 16 November 2021, SAC forces overran and captured the base camp of Kalay PDF in southwestern Sagaing Region, killing 2 fighters and capturing 9 Kalay PDF medics.[121]

In October, SAC-controlled media reported that at least 406 junta informants had been killed and 285 wounded since 1 February in targeted attacks by resistance forces.[122]

Initial conflict (September 2021 – August 2022) [ edit ]

2021–2022 dry season campaigns [ edit ]

According to analyst Matthew Arnold, the civil war's momentum passed critical threshold by the end of the 2022 dry season where the revolutionary sentiment had grown into a broader social and armed resistance that the SAC could no longer suppress.[123] Towards the end of 2021, direct armed clashes gave way to more bombings, explosive devices and landmines. The PDF, with strong ground support from local communities, attacked soft government targets like police stations, outposts and military-owned businesses. Through these, the resistance became more organised as they seized weapons, underwent training and communicated between units through the help of the NUG and allied EAOs.[107] According to the Karen National Union, roughly 2,200 SAC soldiers and militiamen were killed in the first half of 2022.[124]

South-eastern Myanmar [ edit ]

On 17 November 2021, dozens of SAC soldiers ambushed an outpost of the Moebye PDF in Pekon Township, Shan State, forcing the outnumbered PDF soldiers to retreat.[125] At least four SAC soldiers were killed during a four-day clash in Hpruso Township with the KNDF and Karenni Army.[126]

On 14 December, around 200 Tatmadaw troops searched the Karen National Union (KNU)-controlled town of Lay Kay Kaw Myothit near the Thai border, arresting people suspected to be activists or members of the PDF.[127] On 20 December, SAC forces burned down nineteen houses in Kunnar, Loikaw Township after taking it from the KNDF the week before.[128]

On 24 December, more than 35 people were massacred when they were ambushed by SAC troops outside the village of Mo So in Kayah State.[129] Two staff members of the aid group Save the Children were among those killed.[130] The United Nations Security Council condemned the attack and called for a ""thorough and transparent investigation"" into the incident.[131][132]

Throughout February and March 2022, the SAC carried out repeated air strikes against civilian targets in villages in Shan, Kayin and Kayah States. On 17 February alone, around 20 SAC soldiers and 20 resistance fighters were killed in clashes in Mobye, southern Shan State.[133] Witnesses described soldiers systematically looting jewelry, cash, vehicles, and other valuables. Amnesty International reported these actions as collective punishment against the country's ethnic minorities.[134]

Fighting broke out in parts of Loikaw on 14 April.[135] The number of refugees on the Thai border increased after increased combat in Kayin State.[136] On 15 April, SAC soldiers suffered at least 30 casualties after being pushed back by the KNLA at the battle for Lay Kay Kaw.[137]

Central Myanmar [ edit ]

The Dry Zone historical heartland of Myanmar had rarely seen armed violence in the modern conflict in Myanmar since 1948 as a predominantly Buddhist and Bamar farming region. The fighting in the Anya theater of Central Myanmar starting in 2021 changed this trajectory. Without the presence of EAOs, the Bamar PDF groups are characterized as local cells acting autonomously towards simple and directed towards the 2021 coup. In the 2021–2022 dry season, the PDFs began to work more closely together and coordinate towards larger goals.[138] In early 2022, resistance forces were fighting in Monywa, the capital of Sagaing Region.[139] Resistance attacks on the SAC saw the SAC retaliate on civilians[140] Targeted personnel attacks increased, killing various SAC personnel and destroying equipment.[141] The PDF also suffered losses, with 12 fighters killed in a battle in Khin-U Township.[142] Many cities saw violent clashes during 2022's Union Day.[143] Mandalay also saw fighting, with casualties on both sides.[144]

Northern Myanmar [ edit ]

Throughout the 2021–2022 dry season, various groups in Northern Myanmar carried out ambushes against military outposts and convoys. The Kachin Independence Army (KIA) and the PDF attacked convoys in Mohnyin[145] and Hpakant townships.[146] In October, they also partially shut down gold mining operations run by SAC allies.[147] After an ambush near Shwegu, the Tatmadaw responded with airstrikes and ground attacks against KIA bases in Hpakant and Mohnyin Townships.[148] In early February, the KIA assaulted several military bases in Kachin and Shan States, reportedly burning one in Hpakant Township down. The SAC responded by increasing airstrikes and send reinforcements to the area.[149]

The Chinland Defense Force (CDF) and the Chin National Army (CNA) raided and ambushed outposts and convoys in Matupi[150] and Mindat Townships.[151] In December, the Tatmadaw recaptured the town of Thantlang from the CDF in an offensive that destroyed over a quarter of the town's buildings.[152]

On 14 January 2022, units of the CNA moved into Senam village, south of Tamu, in neighboring Sagaing Region to attack a base run by the Indian-based People's Liberation Army of Manipur. After several hours of fighting, between 10 and 20 Manipuri rebels and 1 CNA fighter were killed.[153]

Yangon and other regions [ edit ]

During this time, there were several cases of guerilla warfare across Myanmar using homemade explosives, including several accidents killing resistance fighters. On 17 June 2021, an army vehicle exploded in Tamwe Township, Yangon, allegedly killing several military personnel.[154] On 14 December, Tatmadaw troops captured 12 suspected resistance fighters after several bombs accidentally exploded in Hlaing Thar Yar Township, Yangon.[155] Urban warfare became less practical, so resistance forces began targeting SAC-aligned officials. According to SAC-aligned sources, 367 SAC-appointed officials were assassinated in targeted attacks between February 2021 and February 2022.[156] Resistance forces also began targeting the homes of SAC pilots in Yangon in response to airstrikes on civilians.[157]

Fighting also occurred in other Bamar-majority regions. On 31 January 2022, at least 36 SAC soldiers were reportedly killed in ambushes over three days in Magwe, Sagaing and Tanintharyi regions and Chin, Shan and Kayah states.[158]

2022 monsoon decrease in intensity [ edit ]

The intensity of fighting decreased during the monsoon season.[114] Resistance forces were advantaged by the rainfall as the SAC could not carry out air strikes as easily.[159] In June, resistance groups achieved control of 40–50% of the country. Arakan Army claimed to administer most of Rakhine State with an independent government. Chin National Front and CDF made plans to establish a new government. The KIA and the Wa State, a neutral de-facto independent region of Myanmar, consolidated expanded territories.[160] However, the Myanmar Army retained tight control of almost every city in Myanmar and most of the country's natural resources, including important jade mines.[161] During this time, the PDF were also unable to move beyond rural guerilla tactics. Duwa Lashi La, acting president of the NUG, cited the lack of weaponry and international support as reasons for the prolonged conflict.[77]

On 31 May 2022, a bombing killed one person and injured nine others near the Sule Pagoda in Yangon, the largest city in Myanmar. State media accused the People's Defence Force of being responsible for the attack, which the PDF denied.[162] A July clash in Pekon Township, Shan State also killed around 40 SAC soldiers and 11 PDF fighters.[163]

Massacres and executions [ edit ]

The military deployed its time-tested counterinsurgency methods in what has been called a ""hammer approach"" of bombing and burning villages and massacring civilians to flush out rebel groups. However, the approach was ineffective because they were unable to consolidate power or deter the resistance.[77]

Myanmar military forces executed at least 37 villagers in the Mon Taing Pin massacre in May 2022 after shelling the village of Mondaingbin, Sagaing Region with heavy artillery.[164] The SAC forces entered the local Buddhist monastery, conscripted young male villagers briefly before executing them and other captives by a stupa.[165]

On 23 July 2022, the State Administration Council announced that it had executed four political prisoners, including Zayar Thaw and Kyaw Min Yu, which was the first use of capital punishment in Myanmar since the late 1980s.[166] The men had been accused of helping the resistance movement.[167] The event was widely seen as a provocation to escalate the ongoing conflict by the Tatmadaw.[168] The international community, including United Nations Secretary-General, the G7 nations and the European Union strongly condemned the executions.[169][167]

According to a special report from Radio Free Asia, SAC soldiers following a raid in Kachin state's Se Zin village in August 2022, set fire to more than 400 homes with at least 15 people killed on the spot, detained some 400 people in and around Se Zin, and about 100 of them have been killed (including extrajudicial massacre) by security forces between August 2022 and January 2023 while others died due to horrific prison conditions.[170]

On 16 September 2022, the Burmese military killed 11 children and wounded another 17 in the Let Yet Kone massacre, as part of an airborne strike conducted against a school in Let Yet Kone, Sagaing Region.[171] The military claimed that the village was harbouring resistance fighters from the KIA and PDF.[172] The attack was widely condemned by the international community, including the United Nations and European Union.[173][174]

Later in September 2022, retired Brigadier General Ohn Thwin, mentor to State Administration Council vice-chairman Senior General Soe Win, was assassinated by anti-SAC guerilla groups in Yangon. This assassination caused an increase in security on high-ranking SAC personnel.[175]

Breakdown of Arakan ceasefire, monsoon 2022 [ edit ]

In early 2022, the Arakan Army and the junta clashed again in northern Rakhine State. On 8 February, Arakan Army and junta forces clashed on at least two occasions in Maungdaw in Rakhine State. Fighting broke out on 4 February when junta troops carried out a sneak attack on an AA outpost near the Letpan Mountains northeast of Mee Taik Village, killing an AA sentry, according to AA spokesman Khaing Thukha. Three hours of clashes were also reported on 6 February. The clashes raised fears of a breakdown of the informal ceasefire between the AA and the military which had been in place since November 2020.[176] Further clashes in northern Maungdaw on the night of 7 February killed two civilians.[177] Several junta troops, including a major, were also killed in the attack.[178]

The Bangladesh-Myanmar border

Between June and August 2022, the informal ceasefire reached in late 2020 between the Arakan Army (AA) and the junta broke down. The AA had consolidated control during this period, avoided the initial violence of the war, and introduced many public services and local administrators in northern Rakhine state. With the military's attention diverted to the increasing resistance elsewhere and increasing popular support for an alliance with the NUG, the AA sought to expand its influence into southern Rakhine.[179] Rhetoric from AA leader Twan Mrat Naing in June grew more provocative with military spokespeople stating that the AA was inviting conflict.[180] Armed clashes resumed in July after the junta launched an airstrike against an AA base in Kayin State, killing 6 AA soldiers. AA retaliated in Maungdaw Township and western Chin State in late July and early August. By late August, land travel to northern Rakhine required passing a series of checkpoints and all public transport ships ceased operation due to river and land blockades.[181]

On 16 August 2022, two mortar shells fired by the Myanmar Army landed in a Rohingya refugee camp in Bangladesh, killing one man and injuring five others. Myanmar Army helicopters allegedly entered Bangladeshi air space to attack the Arakan Army and fired a shell within Bangladeshi air space. Two days later, Bangladesh summoned Myanmar ambassador Aung Kyaw Moe to strongly protest the land and airspace violations.[182][183] In October 2022, Bangladeshi Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen made a statement that border bombings by Myanmar stopped after he met with the Chinese ambassador to Bangladesh, Li Jiming.[184]

Escalation of the civil war (September 2022 – November 2022) [ edit ]

Increased resistance efforts [ edit ]

In mid-October 2022, NUG issued a statement calling for the victory of the Spring Revolution by the end of 2023. This call to action was followed by increased fighting by the resistance forces in urban areas and in Southeastern Myanmar.[185] This development took place in the wake of the junta torching at least 20 villages in the Sagaing and Magway Regions as part of a ""four cuts"" strategy of attacking civilians to weaken anti-regime movements. According to Sagaing-based resistance spokespeople, many victims of arson then joined the resistance.[186] The urgency of the resistance was likely prompted by the looming elections planned by the State Administration Council.[185] The fragmentated nature of the grassroots elements of the PDF became more organized in 2022 through the command of the NUG and from cooperation with various EAOs- especially the Kachin Independence Army (KIA).[41]

The Karenni Nationalities Defense Force (KNDF) claimed in January 2023 that 1,692 regime troops and 211 resistance fighters were killed since the 2021 coup, 293 civilians had been killed by the regime, and 126 displaced civilians died while fleeing their homes in Kayah and Shan states in 2022.[187]

Highland attacks [ edit ]

A street in Kawkareik

The Karen National Liberation Army stepped up fighting, besieging the major town of Kawkareik on the Thai border in the 21 October 2022 Battle of Kawkareik.[185] The battle began with surprise attacks on the Asia Highway and at government offices within the town. Resistance forces looked poised to take the town, but ultimately withdrew two days later after facing junta air strikes and strategically drawing junta troops away from nearby positions.[188][189] Four days later, undeterred KNLA-led forces seized a junta Light Infantry Battalion base in Kyain Seikgyi Township.[190]

In Shan State, clashes between PDF forces near Inle Lake and the Pa-O National Organisation (PNO) broke out after the PNO coerced villages for speedboats and militia recruits.[191]

View of the Kalay-Falam Road

In late 2022, Chin State resistance forces used drones in a week-long siege of an outpost in Falam Township, killing 74% of the junta forces stationed, but failing to take the outpost against aerial bombardments.[192] In February 2023, CNA captured Thantlang police station and took control of the town.[193] In Kachin State, the Shanni Nationalities Army (SNA) became more actively allied with the junta as conflict between SNA and the KIA grew. In August, the SNA and the Myanmar Army set fire to hundreds of homes in Kachin state forcing KIA withdrawal from the area.[194]

Chin forces also targeted convoys on roads within the state. In March 2023, combined Chin resistance consisting of CNA, CNDF, and CDFs conducted multiple ambushes on a regime convoy between Kalay, Falam and Hakha capturing and destroyed multiple armoured vehicles.[195] The NUG awarded the combined Chin forces 400 million kyat for seizing two armoured vehicles.[196] The following day, the groups attacked another junta convoy carrying 80 troops on the road between Matupi and Paletwa, killing over 30 junta soldiers.[197] In April, CNDF attacked a junta base on the Kalay-Falam road near Varr, Falam Township, killing eleven regime soldiers and capturing fourteen.[198]

Lowland attacks [ edit ]

In November 2022, resistance in Bago Region increased. In Monyo Township, western Bago Region, the PDF attacked a police building using cluster bombs.[199] In eastern Bago, 15 junta soldiers were killed in a Bago PDF raid on a police station in Yedashe Township.[200] Thousands of civilians also fled Shwegyin Township as joint KNLA and NUG-led resistance forces seized three military outposts.[201]

A rural area near Mawlaik, Sagaing Region

In early December, a video of PDF forces beating and shooting a woman dead emerged on social media. The NUG Ministry of Defence said that the incident happened in June in Tamu, Sagaing and that they were investigating the incident after detaining the perpetrators involved.[202]

In early January 2023, PDF groups in Kani Township, Sagaing Region attacked junta supply ships, killing at least 25 soldiers. The junta increasingly used waterways for supplies, avoiding roadways in resistance-held areas.[203] In April 2023, a combined PDF force from nearby townships seized the Tower Taing hill base Kani Township, killing 30 junta soldiers and seizing weapons.[204][205]

In early 2023, the Mandalay PDF announced their intentions to ramp up military operations.[206] Alongside the TNLA, they engaged in a series of intense clashes with the junta forces in Nawnghkio Township near the Shan-Mandalay border, killing at least 75 junta soldiers and wounding 60 others.[207] A combined force of at least 900 junta and pro-junta militia troops attacked resistance positions with the help of artillery attacks and airstrikes during the clashes but were forced to retreat.[208]

Urban attacks [ edit ]

In 2023, the number of attacks in urban areas increased. In March 2023, the urban guerilla group Urban Owls assassinated Minn Tayzar Nyunt Tin, a legal and money-laundering aide to the junta with links to former Air Force commander General Myat Hein, in Thanlyin, Yangon. Minn Tayzar Nyunt Tin helped draft the repressive Cyber Security Law, which was seen as violating digital rights, privacy and freedom of expression.[209]

Junta retaliation and atrocities [ edit ]

In October 2022, battles and skirmishes increased, as the junta committed several civilian atrocities. On 21 October, junta forces decapitated Saw Tun Moe, a high school teacher from Thit Nyi Naung, and impaled his head on a NUG-administered school's spiked gate after burning and looting Taung Myint village in Magway Region.[210]

Two days later, on 23 October, over 80 people were killed by an airstrike in Hpakant Township, Northern Myanmar, during an anniversary celebration for the Kachin Independence Organisation (KIO). At least 80 civilians were killed, making it the single deadliest attack on civilians since the start of the renewed civil war.[211] The junta denied civilian casualties while the United Nations condemned the attack.[212]

In November 2022, the junta continued burning villages in Sagaing Region, including the home village of Cardinal Charles Maung Bo, the head of the Catholic Church in Myanmar.[213] Junta soldiers also hid in civilian trucks impersonating workers to ambush local defence forces in Shwebo Township.[214]

On 2 February 2023, Min Aung Hlaing imposed martial law in 37 townships with resistance activity, affecting millions of residents.[215]

Scorched earth tactics [ edit ]

In November 2022, the dry season allowed the greater use of the Myanmar Air Force to weaken resistance forces' ability to maintain strategic positions and outposts. Aerial bombardment, helicopter raids and artillery strikes typically followed skirmishes once junta ground forces sustained substantial losses and retreated. Once the entrapped forces were relieved by aerial support, they would engage in scorched earth tactics. World War Two veterans described the destruction as worse than that of the Burma campaign of World War II due to the deliberate targeting of civilian villages.[216] The heavy use of air forces came alongside a decrease in junta's ability to fight on the ground. During the week of 21 November, repeated junta air attacks along the Sagaing-Kachin border killed 80 and disrupted supply chains between the two resistance regions.[217] The junta's scorched earth campaign stretched across northern Myanmar, burning bases and villages they could no longer defend.[218] Thousands of residents fled during the campaign as hundreds of homes were destroyed.[219] In early 2023, one scorched earth push by the junta aimed to resecure the Letpadaung Copper Mine in Salingyi Township for Chinese foreign workers planning to leave for their holidays.[220]

On 23 February 2023, army troops launched a new military offensive in Sagaing, raiding and pillaging villages at the confluence of the Irrawaddy and Mu Rivers. During the offensive, troops from the 99th Light Infantry Division executed at least 17 villagers during the Tar Taing massacre.[221]

Temporary stalemate (November 2022 – September 2023) [ edit ]

November 2022 Arakan ceasefire [ edit ]

Fields in Maungdaw Township, northern Rakhine State

On 26 November 2022, the Arakan Army and the junta agreed to a temporary ceasefire starting on 27 November. The ceasefire was brokered by Yōhei Sasakawa of the Nippon Foundation. Arakan Army spokespeople maintained that they agreed to the ceasefire for humanitarian reasons, as opposed to international pressure. The Arakan Army did not withdraw from fortifications held at the time of the ceasefire.[222] Junta spokespeople said that this was the first step towards a permanent ceasefire with the Arakan Army.[223] As of mid-December, tensions remained high with forces from both sides remaining in deployment within northern Rakhine State.[224]

Subsequent new fronts [ edit ]

On 30 November, the military launched a major assault on the Kokang Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army using heavy weapons on a base near Chinshwehaw by the Chinese border. This assault continued into 2 December, reportedly sending 500 junta soldiers.[225]

The military continued its campaign in northern Shan State against the Ta'ang National Liberation Army (TNLA). On 7 December 2022, the junta launched a ground offensive on the TNLA in the Battle of Namhsan using aerial bombs.[226] After six days of fighting, the TNLA captured four villages from junta control, killing 70 soldiers and capturing 28. On 17 December, the junta retreated, claiming that they reached an agreement with TNLA, and that they intended to target the PDF forces and attacked the TNLA in mistake. The TNLA rejected the statement.[227] Continued clashes in late December forced over a thousand civilians to flee to Mogok.[228]

2023 guerrilla attacks [ edit ]

Burning Car in Lashio, April 2023

According to analysts in early 2023, the civil war was in a state of stalemate. Despite several successful engagements, there was still a significant disparity in power between the joint resistance forces and the junta. The PDF and EAOs faced resource constraints as they primarily relied on donations for funding and underground channels to acquire arms.[41] The resistance also increasingly used coordinated drone attacks, such as on 27 August 2023, when 11 resistance groups jointly conducted drone strikes in Sagaing Township, killing 17 soldiers.[229]

In early April, the Kawthoolei Army (KTLA) launched an offensive on the Karen State Border Guard Force (BGF)-held Shwe Kokko in retaliation for the imprisonment and killing of the group's spokesperson by the BGF. After the reported capture of 5 BGF bases,[230] by 8 April, the offensive began to stall. After junta/BGF counterattacks, the KTLA was forced to retreat, receiving heavy losses. Afterwards, the KNU stated that they did not approve these attacks, nor that they would accept the KTLA in their territory.[231]

In early June 2023, NUG announced the formation of the PDF's first battalion in Yangon Region – Battalion 5101.[232] On 19 June 2023, the Urban Owls guerilla group assassinated Ye Khaing, the operations director and head of security of Yangon International Airport, and a former air force major, outside his house at Mingaladon Township, Yangon. Ye Khaing was allegedly providing information to the junta and detaining anti-junta activists at Myanmar's primary international airport.[233] Urban Owls also claimed that Ye Khaing was a confidante of Steven Law, the owner of Asia World Company, which operates the airport, and is a major supporter of the regime together with the second-in-command, Senior General Soe Win.[234]

In late June 2023, a combined resistance force of PDF and KNLA took control of the National Highway 8 in Mon State, installing checkpoints and arresting junta personnel.[235] Also in June, the Ye Township-based resistance group Ye Belu launched successive guerrilla attacks on the junta in June 2023. On 22 June, they attacked a junta security checkpoint at Chaung Taung bridge, killing four soldiers and one official working for the junta's Ministry of Immigration and Population in Lamaing.[236] On 26 June, the group assassinated a Pyusawhti militia leader in Duya, Ye Township.[237] Two days later, they ambushed an army convoy from the junta's No. 19 Military Operations Command, killing five soldiers and injuring others.[238] The attacks caused a breakdown in junta administration in Ye Township. All administration offices in three towns – namely, Lamaing, Khawzar and Ye – closed down.[239]

On 10 August 2023, junta forces clashed with a coalition of several rebel groups at Thandaung, near Nay Pyi Taw. The rebel forces aimed to capture the 606th Light Infantry Division Headquarters.[240] On 15 September 2023, members of the Northern Thandaung Defence Force, along with the Lethal Prop drone unit, attacked the Aye Lar military base near the Nay Pyi Taw International Airport with 2 makeshift bombs. It was the first documented drone attack by resistance forces against an airbase.[241]

On 31 August and 9 September, the Zomi Revolutionary Army (ZRA) raided 2 Chinland Defense Force (CDF) outposts in Tonzang Township, killing 2 CDF soldiers. These attacks were not the first between the ZRA and Chin resistance, which have been clashing since 2021, and came despite the ZRA issuing a public statement of support for anti-junta resistance in 2021.[11]

2023 monsoon offensives [ edit ]

In August 2023, the NUG claimed that 3,012 junta troops were killed between January and July 2023.[242] In Kayah state alone, 667 military junta troops and 99 resistance members were killed.[242] In a September interview, Duwa Lashi La claimed that resistance forces had taken effective control of about 60% of Myanmar's territory.[243]

In early June 2023, a coalition force of KNLA and other resistance forces ambushed junta forces at Don Tha Mi bridge checkpoints on the border of Karen and Mon States, inflicting heavy casualties.[244] The next day, resistance groups raided the police station and junta offices in Kyain Seikgyi Township, Karen State, killing 10 junta soldiers and injuring 15. The junta retaliated with artillery fire and deployed attack helicopters, killing two local civilians and a monk.[244]

In Kayah State on 13 June 2023, the Karenni National People's Liberation Front (KNPLF), who had previously been in a ceasefire with the junta and became a Border Guard Force in 2009, openly defected to anti-junta forces. The KNPLF began attacking Burmese military positions, joining forces with KA, KNDF, KNLA, and PDF,[245] and seizing junta outposts in the Battle of Mese. The combined forces took over Mese Township in Eastern Kayah State.[246] 430 soldiers of the Light Infantry Battalion, including their lieutenant colonel commander, surrendered to the resistance.[247] Later in July, KNLA forces and allies captured the Lat Khat Taung hill junta base. During an attempt to recapture the hill, 20 junta soldiers were killed and 34 wounded.[248]

From July to September 2023, the Ta'ang National Liberation Army and the Mandalay People's Defence Force jointly conducted Operation Kanaung against junta forces in the Mandalay Region. Over that period, 76 junta soldiers were killed, 19 were wounded, and a large amount of weapons and ammunition were seized.[249][250]

Operation 1027 and concurrent offensives (October 2023 – January 2024) [ edit ]

Operation 1027 (Phase 1) [ edit ]

On 27 October 2023, the Three Brotherhood Alliance initiated an offensive they called Operation 1027, targeting the junta's checkpoints and bases near Lashio and the Phaung Seik border trade post near Chinshwehaw.[251] Chinshwehaw fell into ethnic armies' hands. Lashio Airport and two important China-Myanmar border crossings near Laukkai were closed.[252][253] Over the next three days, the coalition forces captured 57 bases to which the junta responded with aerial bombardments.[254] Simultaneously, the AA engaged junta forces in Htigyaing Township, Sagaing Region.[255]

On 30 October, Nawnghkio fell under limited TNLA and Mandalay PDF control[256] and 41 junta combatants in Kunlong surrendered to the MNDAA.[257] The next day, combined AA and KIA forces captured Gangdau Yang base on the Myitkyina-Bhamo road.[258] A junta convoy came the next day to reinforce Nawnghkio but TNLA and PDF forces blew up an armored car, took weapons and POWs. The convoy retreated and established a camp in southwest Nawnghkio Township, which was assaulted by the rebel forces the following morning.[259] The junta acknowledged having lost control of three towns in Northern Shan State, including Pang Hseng.[260] TNLA, MNDAA, and AA declared control over four towns, including Hsenwi.[261]

TNLA captured the Shan State towns of Namhkam

On 6 November, TNLA forces seized bridges and road gates near Namhkam, Shan State, and took the town after a three-day assault.[262] Kawlin also fell to the coalition, marking the first district-level capital seized during the operation.[263] Over the next three days, the coalition took Khampat, Kunlong and Monekoe across northern Myanmar, re-establishing local government functions after securing towns.[264][265][266] They also took Panlong base in Kunlong Township, killing Brigadier General Aung Kyaw Lwin in the battle,[267] and the strategic Goktwin bridge near the Goteik viaduct on the main Mandalay-China highway.[268]

On 17 November, the TNLA captured the Sakhan Thit Kone base in Namhkam Township, but lost it to a junta offensive the following day. The TNLA accused the junta of using chemical weapon bombs during the counter-siege.[269] Through December, the TNLA seized Namhsan and Mantong taking over the Pa Laung Self-Administered Zone from junta control.[270][271]

On 29 November, the Shan State Progress Party (SSPP) and the Restoration Council of Shan State (RCSS) declared a truce between their respective armies in response to the Operation, with the SSPP stating that the 2 armies ""[intended] to unite as one in the future.""[272]

In early December, the Tatmadaw allegedly reached out to China for it to assert pressure on the Three Brotherhood Alliance to stop Operation 1027.[273] On 11 December, China helped to hold peace talks between the Tatmadaw and various rebel groups, including the Brotherhood Alliance.[274] The Brotherhood Alliance announced later on 13 December that these peace talks ""lasted only 10 minutes"" and vowed to continue fighting.[275]

In late January 2024, BBC News said that the ""bloody two-year stalemate"" of the civil war appears to ""have been broken"" with the success of the offense of the three ethnic armies in the Operation 1027 offense.[48]

Arakan Army offensive [ edit ]

On the morning of 13 November 2023, as part of Operation 1027, the Arakan Army (AA) attacked two Border Guard Police stations in Rathedaung Township, breaking the Rakhine State Ceasefire Agreement between the junta and the Arakan Army. Dong Paik camp was captured by 6:30 am.[45] On 14 November, the junta had already abandoned around 40 outposts in Rakhine state after attacks by the Arakan Army, but few came under their immediate control.[276] Dozens of Myanmar security officers surrendered to the Arakan Army the following day.[277]

On 14 November, the Arakan Army launched an offensive in Paletwa Township in neighbouring Chin State. The Arakan Army accused the Tatmadaw of using chemical weapons during the ensuing battles.[278]

The following night, the Arakan Army launched an attack on Pauktaw, seizing the township police station. By the next morning, the Arakan Army had taken control of the town. The junta sent two helicopter gunships alongside naval support to fire back, including at civilian housing, with heavy machine gun fire. Pauktaw's proximity to the Rakhine state capital, Sittwe, posed a threat to the junta.[279] Junta forces detained about 100 residents who were unable to flee, and positioned themselves to surround the town, using two navy ships to blockade the harbour.[280]

On 6 December, the Arakan Army would capture a major military base in the township.[281]

Battle of Laukkai [ edit ]

In late November and December, the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA) closed in on Laukkai, the capital of the Kokang Self-Administered Zone. They seized several strategic positions from junta forces during the ensuing Battle of Laukkai.[282] MNDAA forces attacked junta bases around the city in early December.[283] On 26 December, ninety junta soldiers surrendered to the MNDAA.[284] and, two days later, the artillery shelling of Laukkai would stop as the city mostly fell under MNDAA control.[285] On 5 January 2024, the MNDAA seized control of the junta battalion headquarters in Laukkai and gained full control of the city.[46]

A few days later, the Three Brotherhood Alliance claimed it had captured the towns of Kutkai and Theinni on 8 January after seizing junta military posts in the towns, including the headquarters of the 16th Military Operations Command in Theinni.[286] On 23 January, the Tatmadaw sentenced three of the brigadier generals who surrendered at Laukkai to death and the other three to life imprisonment, under military law.[287]

In the wake of these gains and the fall of Laukkai, on 12 January, China announced that it had negotiated another ceasefire between the junta and the 3BA, known as the ""Haigeng Agreement"".[288] The two sides agreed to disengage personnel and to not compromise the safety of Chinese border residents.[289] However, the following day, the TNLA reported that the junta had broken their agreement with airstrikes in Lashio Township and Kyaukme Township.[290]

Tatmadaw defensive response [ edit ]

The Irrawaddy reported on 22 November 2023 that the Tatmadaw was preparing 14,000 soldiers for the defence of Naypyitaw, including by moving troops from other regions to the capital and mobilizing civil servants into the military. These preparations started soon after Operation 1027 was launched against the Tatmadaw. In addition, the Tatmadaw was preparing 10,000 troops for the defence of Mandalay, Bago and Yangon. There were also fortification works beginning, with Naypyitaw police stations ""also preparing concrete blocks, sandbags and other materials needed to transform into defensive bases in just a few days"".[291]

Ronan Lee, a professor at Loughborough University, stated that the recent strategic reversals, nationwide territorial losses and economic decline meant momentum had strongly shifted away from Myanmar's junta, and the junta ""may now be in a death spiral"".[292]

Concurrent operations [ edit ]

Operation 1027 was supported by several concurrent operations by other anti-junta groups elsewhere in the country, including in the eastern regions Shan State and Kayah State. In northern Shan State, the KNLA and PDF clashed with the Tatmadaw around the town of Kawkareik in late October 2023.[293] In Mese Township (part of Kayah State), the KNPLF, KA and KNDF launched a joint military operation called Operation 1107 that captured several border posts starting on November 7.[294][295] Four days later, they launched the major Operation 1111 against Loikaw, the capital of Kayah State.[296] The military operations in Kayah displaced tens of thousands of civilians, especially from Loikaw.[297] After over a month of heavy fighting, rebel forces had won control of 85% of the capital.[298] Nonetheless, fighting has continued into January.[299] By late January, however, the offensive on Loikaw had mostly stalled.[300]

Other anti-junta forces launched Operation Taungthaman in Madaya Township, Mandalay Region. On 13 November, fighting erupted in Kinn Village, eastern Madaya Township between the TNLA and the junta, who responded with air and artillery strikes and later burning the village down.[301] By 28 November, PDF and TNLA forces captured a junta base in the township.[302] The TNLA additionally supported the operations with attacks in Nawnghkio and Kyaukme Townships in southern Shan State to cut off junta reinforcements.[303]

Chin offensive [ edit ]

On the morning of 13 November 2023, after two days of fighting, the Chin National Army (CNA) and local Chinland Defense Force (CDF) units, captured the town of Rikhawdar on the India–Myanmar border.[304] This marked the first town captured by resistance forces in Chin State since the coup. At least 40 junta soldiers and police officers fled to the Indian state of Mizoram, where they surrendered and were eventually repatriated.[305] The Chin National Defence Force (CNDF), took a junta camp on the Mizoram border two days later.[306] The following week on 21 November, local Zoland PDF units seized a military base on Kennedy Peak, the second highest mountain in Chin State.[307] Over the next week, CNA and its allies captured Lailenpi[308] and Rezua in Matupi Township.[309]

On 6 December 2023, the Chin National Front ratified the Chinland Constitution, proclaiming the state of Chinland.[310]

On 17 January 2024, the Taingen camp on the Falam road to the Indian border was captured, with Chin resistance forces seizing arms and ammunition.[311] On 20 January 2024, after more than 600 junta soldiers and refugees crossed the India–Myanmar border, the Government of India announced a plan to fence the entire border.[312]

New conflict landscape (January 2024–May 2024) [ edit ]

Following the fall of Laukkai and the junta facing serious threats by the Three Brotherhood Alliance, the war has turned into a more multipolar landscape with borderlands being seized by powerful anti-junta groups with significant implications for the foreign relations of Myanmar. Groups not a part of the alliance took advantage of the situation, but remained constrained by both tense relations and limited coordination.[313]

Rakhine offensive intensifies [ edit ]

Map of gains made by the Arakan Army since 2023

On 8 January 2024, the Arakan Army continued their offensive and captured the Taung Shey Taung base and its 200 junta soldiers in Kyauktaw Township, Rakhine State. On 15 January, the Arakan Army seized Paletwa, a strategic town for Indo-Myanmar infrastructure projects, and the entire township in Chin State.[314][315] A week later, the Arakan Army captured the town of Pauktaw in Rakhine State concluding a three-month battle.[316]

On 3 February 2024, as the clashes between Arakan Army and Tatmadaw increased in Rakhine, mortar shells and several bullets reportedly landed in Bangladesh territory, which injured some local residents near Ukhia, Cox's Bazar.[317] At least 229 Myanmar Border Guard Police (BGP) personnel entered Bangladesh seeking refuge from AA, where the Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) disarmed them.[318]

Between 4 February and 6 February, the Arakan Army launched attacks on Rakhine BGP outposts in Maungdaw Township, later alleging without providing evidence that the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army and Rohingya Solidarity Organisation (RSO) fought alongside the Rakhine BGP.[319] The RSO denounced AA's accusations and the AA labeling them as ""Bengalis"" among other issues.[319] Later in February when the junta began conscripting largely non-citizen displaced Rohingyas living in Kyaukphyu, the AA urged Rohingya people to flee into AA-controlled areas.[320]

Fall of Mrauk U [ edit ]

The Arakan Army captured most of the remaining Tatmadaw bases in Minbya Township by 6 February.[321] The Arakan Army captured Kyauktaw the next day and continued fighting in Mrauk U and Ramree.[322] The Tatmadaw abandoned Myebon to reinforce Kyaukphyu on 9 February, leaving ammunition behind in their rush and abandoning the southern township of Mrauk-U District.[323]

On 10 February, AA took the district capital town of Mrauk U completing their control over the township. During the battle, three Myanmar Navy landing craft were reportedly sunk.[47]

Over the next week, the Arakan Army consolidated control over the district capturing Myebon on 15 February[324] and capturing the remainder of Minbya Township on 28 February.[325]

New Shan State combatants [ edit ]

Southern Shan state mountains near Hopong

Early 2024 also saw a new theatre re-emerge in southern Shan state when, the Tatamadaw and the Pa-O National Army (PNA) attempted to confiscate the Pa-O National Liberation Army (PNLA)'s weapons on 20 January.[326] The PNLA, supported by KNDF and PDF forces, attacked Hsi Hseng eventually capturing the town on 26 January 2024.[327] The PNLA's political wing formally revoked their participation in the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement, pledged to help the NUG replace the Junta with a federal system and urged the PNA's political wing to defect.[6]

Between 21 January and 24 February, junta shelling killed 40 civilians in the Pa-O Self-Administered Zone, according local activists.[328] Towards the end of February, clashes between junta/PNA forces and PNLA forces broke out east of Hopong[329] and along the Taunggyi-Loilem road.[330] The junta regained control of Hsi Hseng by late March,[331] amid accusations of using chemical bombs according to the PNLA.[332]

Between 26 and 27 March the MNDAA and the Shan State Army (SSPP) clashed in Hseni Township after the alleged MNDAA bombing of SSPP camps.[333] On 3 May, the Shan State Progress Party announced that its armed forces would join revolutionary forces before retracting the statement two days later.[334] On 27 May, after a month of warnings, the TNLA began blockading several villages in Namhkam Township and detaining SSPP soldiers stationed in those villages. In response, the SSPP withdrew from camps in Hsenwi, Kutkai, and Pang Hseng.[335]

The United Nations voiced deep concern over renewed fighting in eastern Myanmar and allegations that the Myanmar armed forces employed heavy weapons against civilians, as well as abducted and forcibly recruited children in its ranks. Its Special Adviser on Prevention of Genocide and the Special Adviser on Responsibility to Protect also highlighted the responsibility of the military to protect all people.[336]

Junta counteroffensive in Anyar [ edit ]

Tatmadaw forces recaptured the district capital of Kawlin on 10 February after almost 10 days of fighting.[337] Junta forces razed the town, destroying the majority of homes in Kawlin and surrounding villages.[338] On 22 February, junta forces attempted to recapture the town of Maw Luu from the KIA and ABSDF.[339] On 14 March, junta forces took the village of Kampani, Kalay Township to weaken anti-junta attacks on Kalay.[340] Despite this campaign, on 16 March resistance forces captured the Pyusawhti-controlled village of Kyaung Taik north of Kalay.[341]

While the junta launched its counteroffensives, allied resistance launched an offensive to capture Kani, capturing around 80% of the town by 7 March.[342] After almost 10 days of fighting, by 15 March, rebels were forced retreat after overwhelming junta resistance.[343]

On 4 April 2024, the PDF launched an unprecedented drone attack against Aye Lar airbase, the main Tatmadaw headquarters, and Min Aung Hlaing's residence in the capital, Naypyidaw. Almost 30 drones were deployed; junta forces claimed 7 were shot down[344] while Myawaddy TV said 13 fixed-wing drones were shot down and there were no casualties or damage to property. NUG claimed the attack was ""a success"".[345] On 12 April, local People's Defense Forces claimed that they killed over a dozen junta soldiers in another attack on Aye Lar Airbase.[346]

On 19 April junta forces launched a counteroffensive to retake Shwe Pyi Aye, Homalin Township, after it was captured in November 2023.[347]

Junta control of Karen weakens [ edit ]

After Operation 1027 and the Battle of Kawkareik in October 2023, the KNLA continued to make gains throughout Karen State, Mon State, Bago Region, and Tanintharyi Region.[348] On 29 January 2024, KNLA and PDF forces shot down a Tatmadaw Eurocopter AS365, killing Brigadier General Aye Min Naung of the 44th Light Infantry Division.[349] In late February, PDF and KNLA forces took most of Myitta, Tanintharyi Region.[350] By 29 February, KNLA and aligned forces captured half of Kawkareik township, gaining fire control over the Myawaddy-Kawkareik highway.[351] The KNLA continued gaining pushing east on the highway,[352] capturing the Hpu Lu Gyi camp, south of Myawaddy, after a ""five minute fight"". This camp held both strategic and moral significance as the historic staging point for attacks on Manerplaw and Kawmoora after the junta captured it in 1990.[353] The next day, KNLA forces captured a junta base in Kyaikdon.[354] Fighting also broke out in KNLA 7th Brigade territory near Methawaw, forcing a junta retreat.[355]

Tensions also rose between the junta and the Karen State Border Guard Force (BGF), who refused orders to engage in battle and withdrew from their bases in Papun.[356] On 23 January, deputy commander-in-chief Soe Win met with Karen BGF leader Colonel Saw Chit Thu[357] The Karen BGF announced they would no longer accept salaries from the junta, and would remain ""neutral"" in the conflict. Later, on 6 March, the Karen BGF announced it would rename itself to the ""Karen National Army"".[358]

Kachin conflict escalates [ edit ]

While the KIA is a very close military and political partners with the Three Brotherhood Alliance, being part of the Northern Alliance, it was not affected by the Chinese-brokered ceasefire. Combined forces of the KIA, ABSDF, and Kachin PDF captured the town of Mongmit on 19 January and neighboring Mabein on the 20th. The next day, they captured the strategically significant Man Wein Gyi base near Ruili.[359] However, the junta would recapture Mongmit on 25 January.[360]

The KIA also intensified attacks in Hpakant Township,[360] capturing a camp southwest of Hpakant on 20 January and[361] threatening the Myitkyina-Hpakant road with the capture of Namtein outpost on 2 February.[362] There were also attacks in Mansi Township, including the capture of the Si Kham Gyi base, which had continually been held by the junta for 30 years.[359]

On 7 March the KIA simultaneously launched attacks on over ten junta outposts in eastern Kachin. Fighting primarily took place along the highway between Bhamo and the Kachin State capital, Myitkyina, as well as around Laiza. The attacks were the beginning of a wider offensive in Kachin State- colloquially termed Operation 0307.[363] Over 8 March, the KIA seized three major junta bases and several outposts, including Hpyun Pyen Bum, the junta's closest forward base to KIA headquarters in Laiza.[364] The KIA and AA defending Laiza alleged that junta airstrikes had landed on the Chinese side of the border, east of Laiza.[365] During the fighting, the leader of the junta-aligned Lisu ""Wuyang People's Militia"", U Shwe Min, was killed.[366] By 22 March, the KIA claimed to have captured over 50 military outposts and 13 strategically significant junta bases around the Myitkyina-Bhamo Road.[367]

In April, the KIA had captured the key Chinese border trade hub of Lweje,[368] cut off a major road to Hpakant,[369] and captured Sezin.[370] and Hsinbo. Within Hsinbo, they cut off the Bhamo-Myitkyina road and encircled Bhamo.[371] The KIA then launched simultaneous offensives throughout Waingmaw Township and around Sumprabum, capturing several junta bases, camps and command centers.[372] By 8 May, they had captured 11 battalion headquarters throughout the state[373] and captured Sumprabum Township.[374]

Through the rest of May, the KIA captured Momauk after junta soldiers retreated,[375] attacked a bridge at the entrance of the state capital Myitkyina.[376] and made gains in Mansi[377] and Tanai[378] The KIA took an additional dozen junta bases in Waingmaw Township starting in 20 May, securing their positions.[379]

Continued Rakhine offensive [ edit ]

At the same time, the Rakhine offensive continued through March. On 5 March, the Arakan Army captured Ponnagyun and threatening the regional capital Sittwe, only 33 kilometres away.[380] On 17 March, continued Arakan Army assaults took Rathedaung and its township, cutting off Sittwe from the rest of Rakhine by land.[381]

On 12 March, after an 85-day battle, the Arakan Army captured the town of Ramree. The capture of Ramree brought nearly all of Ramree Island under the Arakan Army's control except for the deep sea port city of Kyaukphyu.[382]

On 24 March, the Arakan Army began an offensive in central Rakhine concurrently with their offensive on Sittwe, launching attacks on Ann, the headquarters of the junta's Western Command. North of Ann, the Arakan Army launched attacks on neighbouring Ngape Township in Magway Region. Ann's location is strategically important as the link between Rakhine and Magway via the Minbu-Ann road through the Arakan Mountains and as a gateway preventing AA from attacking southern Rakhine State.[383] Through April, the Arakan Army captured a portion of the Ann-Minbu Highway, cutting off Ann from neighboring Padein,[384] and captured bases in the hilltops of Ann township.[385]

Northern Rakhine offensives saw little territory change until 3 May when the Arakan Army captured the headquarters of the Border Guard Police in Maungdaw Township at Kyee Kan Pyin,[386] forcing at least 128 junta soldiers to cross the border into Bangladesh.[387] Buthidaung and its surrounding township fell to the Arakha Army on 18 May.[388] After its capture, Rohingya activists accused the Arakan Army of burning and targeting Rohingya homes in the town, a claim which the Arakan Army denied.[389]

On 29 May, junta and allied Arakan Liberation Army soldiers killed over 70 villagers in Byian Phyu near Sittwe due to suspected Arakan Army sympathies in the village.[390]

From late May to early June, the Arakan Army launched attacks on the remainder of Maungdaw Township. On 16 June, the AA urged the residents of Maungdaw to evacuate the town, claiming that all junta bases in the township had either been captured or encircled, and that they would attack the town.[391] In response, the Bangladesh Navy deployed warships to the disputed St. Martin's Island, which had been shot at several times by junta forces.[392] On 4 July, the AA entered Maungdaw, attacking the last junta holdout in the town.[393]

Capture of Papun and Myawaddy [ edit ]

On 20 March, the Karen National Liberation Army and its PDF allies began to besiege the town of Papun, the capital of Hpapun District, Karen State. Eight days later, the town was captured, with fighting moving to the hills outside the town.[53]

After a prolonged siege and several days of negotiations, on 5 April over 600 junta soldiers and their families in Myawaddy surrendered to the KNU and withdrew across the border to Mae Sot,[394] leaving only the 275th Light Infantry Battalion (LIB) near the western entrance to defend the town. By 10 April, KNLA and PDF troops captured the LIB base with the 200 LIB soldiers withdrawing to the 2nd Thai-Myanmar Friendship Bridge on the border. This prompted Thailand to deploy the 3rd Army along the border.[395] The junta sent reinforcements to retake the town, but they were stalled in Kyondoe.[396] On 12 April, Thai officials and the KNU confirmed the capture of Myawaddy.[397] The junta retaliated with airstrikes although locals reported no KNLA presence in the streets.[398]

Despite the KNLA's major role in the battle, they ceded control of the town to the Karen National Army (KNA) to ensure security[399] and reportedly due to the KNA's role in negotiations for the initial surrender.[400]

On 19 April the KNLA attacked the remaining LIB 275th soldiers who were still holding out under the 2nd Thai-Myanmar Friendship Bridge. The junta responded with airstrikes, killing several civilians and forcing the KNLA to delay further attacks.[401][402]

Continued battle for Myawaddy [ edit ]

After Myawaddy's capture the junta launched Operation Aung Zeya, a counteroffensive to retake the town led by Light Infantry Division (LID) 55, numbering around 1,000 and reportedly led by the junta's second-in-command Soe Win. On 16 April, the LID 55 began attempting to cross the Dawna Range[403] but was continually intercepted by the KNLA and allies, being forced to retreat and reportedly experiencing heavy losses.[404]

Early in the counteroffensive KNLA forces withdrew from most of Kawkareik.[405] On 21 April, a junta convoy was routed in Kawkareik Township,[406] but junta forces successfully recaptured Kawkareik the next day despite losing vehicles to the KNLA.[407]

On 23 April, the KNA helped the LIB 275th soldiers sheltering under the 2nd Friendship Bridge to retake their base west of Myawaddy.[408] The following day, KNU spokesman stated that they would ""temporarily withdraw"" from Myawaddy, but vowed to continue guerrilla attacks along the AH1.[409]

The stalled LID 55 advancement moving through the Dawna Range reached the Taw Naw waterfall by 29 April.[410] However, the counteroffensive was stalled again, without any major gains the following month. Residents reported that the KNA had helped ""hundreds"" of junta soldiers to reach Myawaddy through forested paths.[411]

Mon and Karenni resistance [ edit ]

Karenni resistance continued with Operation 1111 aiming to capture Kayah State and its capital Loikaw. On 12 January, joint Karenni forces captured Pekon in neighboring Shan State.[299] On 29 January, the Karenni Nationalities Defence Force (KNDF) captured the town of Mawchi.[412] On 14 February, combined forces of the Karenni Army (KA) and KNDF captured the town of Shadaw after almost a month-long battle, marking the second township to be completely captured in the state.[413] Karenni forces captured Hpasawng and most of Hpasawng Township on 14 March.[414] In a joint statement on 23 March, the KNDF and allies announced that they were in control of nearly 90% of Kayah State, having captured 65 junta positions throughout the state, and six out of nine towns in Kayah[p] (excluding Moebye in Southern Shan State).[52]

On 20 January 2024, local resistance forces in Ye Township, Mon State intensified attacks, announcing their intent to capture Ye.[415] On 14 February, the New Mon State Party (Anti-Military Dictatorship) (MNLA-AMD) split from the Mon National Liberation Army (a signatory of the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement) and effectively declared war on the junta.[416] Around 22 March, Mon State resistance groups began vehicle inspections near Kaleinaung, prompting the junta close roads.[417] On 25 March, the MNLA-AMD and allies, captured the Kawt Bein Police Station in Kawkareik Township, Karen State.[418] In response, junta forces shelled the Kawt Bein area[419] and eventually recaptured the area after a battle on 25 April.[420]

On 8 April, Mon PDF forces launched drone attacks on the Southeastern Command headquarters in Mawlamyine while junta deputy commander-in-chief Soe Win was present. Whether Soe Win was affected remains unknown.[421]

On 29 May, junta forces launched an offensive to resecure Loikaw from Karenni resistance – which had controlled around 80% of the city since November 2023. Junta colums advanced on Loikaw,[422] reaching Kayan Tha Yar village 10 kilometres north of Loikaw the next day[423] and then the Loikaw-Mobye-Hsi Hseng intersection by 3 June before stalling.[331] On 25 June, Karenni resistance captured Maesalawng Hill, near Bawlakhe, after a six day offensive.[424]

Junta counteroffensives in Southern Myanmar [ edit ]

From 8 May to 20 May, junta forces also conducted an offensive throughout Thayetchaung Township, the longest of such offensives in Tanintharyi Region since the 2021 coup. The offensive displaced 5,000 civilians from 8 villages.[425]

In late May, junta forces captured Pedak outpost on the road between Dawei and Myeik.[426] In early June, around 600 junta soldiers were sent to recapture areas of the Ye - Dawei highway from Karen, Mon, and PDF forces who had captured the highway in March, The junta used heavy artillery and the resistance warned civilians to avoid the road, accusing the junta of using human shields and reinforcements disguised as civilians.[427] On 1 July, junta forces launched an offensive on the Zardi Village Tract of Yebyu Township, attempting to recapture areas surrounding the Dawei Special Economic Zone.[428]

Second phase of Operation 1027 and renewed rebel advances (June 2024-August 2024) [ edit ]

Map of anti-junta gains made during Operation 1027 as of September 2024

In June 2024, the Three Brotherhood Alliance's Haigeng ceasefire with the junta broke down seeing junta battalions destroyed and multiple towns in Shan state and beyond fall to the resistance, culminating in the capture of the Northern Shan State capital and headquarders of the Northeast Command, Lashio, in August 2024.[429] Outside Shan State, the Myanmar military faced significant losses in Rakhine State where the Arakan Army gained almost full control by August 2024. In Mandalay, the Brotherhood Alliance and other armed groups escalated attacks, getting close to Mandalay. Despite these setbacks, the military continued efforts to reassert control, including forming new militias and intensifying conscription across the country.[430] Although 1027 began in Shan State, widespread escalation dramatically shifted the balance of power, leading to EAOs in other areas making dominant gains and crippling the military junta with personnel attritions and historic levels of defections.[431]

Operation 1027 (Phase 2) [ edit ]

While it took until June for the Haigeng ceasefire to fully breakdown, tensions began as early as March. The ceasefire was formalised on 1 March at a meeting in Kunming, with the junta reportedly agreeing to recognise the MNDAA's authority over Kokang.[432] But as early as 26 March, junta forces attempted to invade MNDAA territory near Lashio but was repelled militarily.[433] In response, the Chinese ambassador to Myanmar met with the junta foreign minister to discuss ending the clashes.[434]

Tensions began to grow again in Northern Shan State on 9 June after the junta launched airstrikes on TNLA positions in Mongmit Township. TNLA would accuse the junta of violating the ceasefire.[435] Through mid-June, junta forces amassed near 3BA-territories and destroyed roads in the area[436][437]

On 23 June, the junta clashed with Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA) near Lashio.[438] and with the TNLA around Kyaukme, Nawnghkio Township, and Mogok Township on 24 June.[439] On 25 June, the TNLA announced that it had restarted Operation 1027 in Northern Shan State,[440] and encircled Kyaukme.[441]

On 26 June, most of Nawnghkio was captured by PDF and TNLA forces.[442] By 28 June, the TNLA had captured most of the district capital town Kyaukme and continued attacking the junta bases around the town.[55]

Southern Rakhine offensives [ edit ]

Concurrently in early June, the Arakan Army made significant gains in southern Rakhine state. On 2 June, clashes erupted on the Thandwe-Taungup highway and near the resort beach of Ngapali, Thandwe Township,[443] trapping resort goers.[444] Over the next week, the fighting moved closer to Thandwe, forcing the Thandwe Airport to close.[445]

On 15 June, the Arakan Army clashed with junta forces near neighbouring Taungup[446] and on the Taungup-Pandaung road.[447] After months of relative peace in the area, heavy clashes broke out outside of Kyaukphyu on 17 June as junta forces left Danyawaddy naval base.[448]

On 23 June, AA forces captured Thandwe Airport, the first airport to be captured by resistance forces since the 2021 coup.[449] The airport's capture was not confirmed for another week, with AA claiming that 400 junta soldiers had died in the battle.[450] The AA began attacking the beach itself on 26 June.[451] On 17 July, AA forces captured Thandwe itself after three weeks of fighting.[452]

Continued Chin offensive and infighting [ edit ]

Various Chin actors continued the war against the junta in early 2024, with resistance efforts picking up in May. However, in June, the Chin resistance began to engage in conflict with each other as infighting increased in June. Signs of infighting began as early as January when CDFs and CNA clashed with the Maraland Defence Force (MDF), a CBA member.[453] The infighting in Chin State became broadly split along those aligned with the Chin Brotherhood Alliance (CBA) and the Chinland Council, which is dominated by the Chin National Army (CNA). Local Chinland Defense Forces (CDFs) are generally aligned with the CBA, though some like the CDF-Mara are aligned with the CNA.[454]

On 2 May 2024, CBA aligned groups captured the strategic town of Kyindwe, Kanpetlet Township with the aid of the Arakan Army during the conclusion of the four-month long Battle of Kyindwe.[455] The CC would then attempt to take Tonzang from the junta and its ally the Zomi Revolutionary Army[456] capturing the town and neighbouring Cikha by 21 May.[457]

The following week, the CBA moved on neighbouring Tedim,[458] By mid-June, the Junta pushing back from Tedim, recaptured positions along the Tedim-Kalay road and took back Kennedy Peak.[459] Junta forces pushed as far as to recapture the strategic Tainngen village[460] before losing both Kennedy Peak and Taingen to Chinland Council-led counteroffensives and retreating to Khaing Kham by 27 June.[461] On 27 July, the CNA and ZRA met in Aizawl for peace negotiations.[462]

On 30 May, CDF-Matupi captured the district administrative office on the Matupi-Hakha road in Matupi Township.[54] On 24 June, CDFs clashed with junta forces outside of the Chin State capital Hakha. The junta retaliated by setting fires to homes in the town.[463] On 20 July, as part of ""Operation Rung"", the CDF-Hakha captured the Hakha Main Police Station, releasing 62 detainees.[464]

Operation Chin Brotherhood [ edit ]

Matupi town, captured by Operation Chin Brotherhood on 29 June 2024

On 9 June, the CBA, Arakan Army and Magway-based Yaw Army began ""Operation Chin Brotherhood"" attacking Matupi.[465] Shortly after the announcement, the Chinland Council issued a statement asking the Arakan Army to refrain from military and administrative operations in Chinland.[466] This came days after Global Khumi Organisation urged the Arakha Army against committing human rights violations against the Khumi Chin people of Paletwa Township.[467]

Operation Chin Brotherhood continued with CBA aligned forces capturing one of the two junta battalion bases outside Matupi on 17 June.[468] Clashes between the CBA and CBA broke out during the push towards the final base, leading to 2 CBA deaths.[469] The CNA/Chinland Council was forced to retreat from the Matupi area by 24 June[470] On 29 June, the CBA captured the remaining junta base near Matupi and took over the town.[471]

Infighting continued with CNA detaining other Yaw Defense Force soldiers[472] and MDF and AA taking Lailenpi, Matupi Township from the CDF-Mara and CNA.[473]

Kachin theater [ edit ]

On 4 June renewed clashes broke out outside of Momeik.[474] A week later, KIA forces captured the Waingmaw-Sadung-Kanpaikti road, cutting off the state capital Myitkyina from the border.[475]

On 15 July, junta forces launched an offensive to recapture areas near Momauk.[476] A month later, on 19 August, KIA forces captured the last junta base in Momauk, completing their capture of the township.[477] Shortly after, junta forces launched another counteroffensive to retake the town, but were stalled at Aung Myay village.[478]

Karenni fighting [ edit ]

On 1 July, junta forces began attacking KNDF positions south of Pinlaung, attempting to relieve the Karenni siege on Pekon.[479]

In early July, fighting further intensified in Loikaw as Karenni resistance attempted to recapture areas of the town they had earlier been forced to withdraw from.[480] The Irrawaddy reported on 8 July that fighting is intensifying after reinforcements of 500 troops had arrived to help the already stationed 1,500 Tatmadaw troops.[481]

By mid July in Hpasawng Township, there has been reports of fresh intense fighting, incl. Karenni claims of poisoned gas use by Tatmadaw against the resistance fighters.[482] Meanwhile, in Loikaw, pro-Tatmadaw sources confirm fighting in Loikaw, Pekhon and Mobye. In addition it claims Tatmadaw progress in the direction of Loikaw University.[483]

Battle of Lashio [ edit ]

Map showing the Battle of Lashio during July–August 2024

Smoke rising from Lashio after the bombing, July 2024

On 2 July, the MNDAA began the Battle of Lashio against the heavily defended capital and largest town of northern Shan State. The TNLA joined the offensive the next day with the 2 armies attacking 4 junta bases surrounding Lashio. Pro-junta Telegram channels accused the Shan State Progress Party (SSPP) of joining the offensive.[484] On 5 July, TNLA forces entered Lashio proper from the south.[485] The next day, the MNDAA captured Nampawng village south of Lashio, encircling the town, and began launching attacks into Lashio.[486]

Concurrently MNDAA forces clashed with junta forces in Mongyai Township[487] and TNLA began launching attacks into Momeik.[488]

Tensions and disputes rose between TNLA and the Shan State Army (SSPP), with both sides asking the United Wa State Army (UWSA) for mediation.[489] On 10 July, the TNLA attacked junta positions near Tangyan.[490] Following an agreement with the Tatmadaw, the neutral UWSA deployed thousands of soldiers around Tangyan to prevent clashes from spreading to the area.[491] On 13 July, SSPP forces occupied Mongyai, with residents claiming that clashes might break out in the town due to the apparent SSPP-junta agreement.[492]

On 25 July, in a ""historic victory"", the MNDAA claimed to have captured the Northeastern Command headquarters of Lashio, the first regional command headquarters to ever be captured by resistance forces.[493] On 30 July, MNDAA forces ambushed junta reinforcements attempting to reach Lashio, inflicting heavy casualties.[494] On 3 August, the capture of Lashio and the Northeastern Command headquarters was confirmed, with hundreds of Burmese soldiers surrendering.[57] The Northeastern Command had exiled their leadership to Muse, which remained the last junta stronghold in the area due to its proximity with the Chinese border.[495]

Ceasefire attempts and ""Shan-Man"" [ edit ]

On 14 July, the MNDAA instituted a tenuous 4-day ceasefire after meeting with the Chinese Communist Party. Despite the ceasefire, clashes continued.[496][497] TNLA and SSPP leaders also met in Panghsang, Wa State, to discuss an end to clashes.[498] On 16 July, TNLA captured most of Mongmit and began launching attacks on the junta headquarters south of the town.[56]

At the same time as the renewed 1027 offensive, the NUG announced that it had joined in the offensive through its People's Defense Forces in Mandalay Region, calling the attacks a ""Shan Man"" operation.[499] As part of Operation Shan-Man, the Mandalay People's Defence Force (MDY-PDF) captured 36 junta positions in late June and early July throughout northern Mandalay Region.[500] The MDY-PDF and TNLA also captured Nawnghkio on 10 July[501] and Singu Township by 12 July, further cutting off junta forces in Northern Shan State.[502]

Mogok, Mandalay Region

On 20 July, the 3BA, reportedly under pressure from China, agreed to extend the ceasefire to 31 July.[503] Despite the agreements, junta reinforcements launched renewed attacks on Kyaukme on the same day.[504] On 24 July, TNLA and PDF forces completely captured Mogok, Mandalay Region.[505]

The TNLA captured the Shan state towns of Momeik on 31 July[506] and Kyaukme on 6 August.[507] On 10 August, TNLA forces launched an offensive against Hsipaw, capturing the town's prison[508] and then nearby Nawngkawgyi village by 13 August.[509]

On 12 August, MDY-PDF captured Tagaung, the first historical capital of the Burmese monarchy, after a one-day battle.[510] The following week, Mandalay-PDF captured Thabeikkyin, capturing the town and its surroundings. The entirety of Thabeikkyin District came under rebel control.[511]

Stalemates, Chinese pressure, and western front escalations (August 2024 – March 2025) [ edit ]

After the fall of Lashio, the junta launched counter offensives, but facing an inability to make progress, changed its tactics to favour aerial bombardment to destroy towns they could not take, like Lashio.[512] The rebels, too, have failed to make as much progress due to diplomatic pressures and supply issues. Analyst Yun Sun from the Stimson Center noted Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi's visit in mid-August as indicative of a shift in China's stance from greenlighting Operation 1027 in November 2023 to endorsing the State Administration Council and criticising the Northern Alliance and the United Wa State Army (UWSA) for not standing down.[513] There are signs that China is accelerating weapons transfers to the junta and restricting key ammunition supplies to the TNLA, affecting the resistance's realistic prospects of taking Mandalay despite the junta being in its weakest position since 2021.[514] However, this recent alignment with the military regime has strained its influence over border groups like the 3BA, diminishing China's sway and ability to mediate in this new landscape.[515] China's support temporarily slowed the rebels' momentum but failed to reverse the trend of humiliating losses, including the fall of a second Regional Military Command in Ann, Rakhine State. Instead, China finds its interests threatened as the Arakan Army surround Kyaukphyu and Kachin groups seize control of rare earth mineral mines.[431] Chinese-backed peace talks and pressure for MNDAA to retreat from Lashio continued in early 2025 but failed in late March 2025.[516]

In January 2025, The New York Times reported that the rebels were opening colleges and universities in the territory they controlled.[517]

Operation Hsinphyushin [ edit ]

Street in Nawnghkio

In late August, the Tatmadaw began preparing an offensive to recapture key towns in northern Shan State, terming it as “Operation Hsin Phyu Shin” (after the Burmese king Hsinbyushin).[518] Throughout September and October, the Tatmadaw began massing forces in the final towns it controlled in Northern Shan State (Namlan, Mongyai, and Tangyan) in preparation for the counteroffensive to retake Lashio.[519]

This came in the context of strained China-3BA relations. On 29 August, the Ruili City Security Commission issued a statement demanding the TNLA to end all offensive operations against the junta, threatening ""more deterrent and disciplinary measures"" if it did not.[520] 4 days later, the junta designated the Three Brotherhood Alliance and its members as ""terrorist groups"".[521] On 19 September, the MNDAA announced that it would end its offensive operations, further stating it would refuse to ever work with the National Unity Government of Myanmar.[522] Despite the Chinese threat, the TNLA captured the last junta base in Hsipaw on 13 October.[523]

On 19 October, Tatmadaw forces launched a counteroffensive, aimed at retaking Nawnghkio instead of Lashio.[524]

On 18 November, it was confirmed that MNDAA leader Peng Daxun had been detained in Yunnan by Chinese authorities since late October, further pressuring MNDAA forces to relinquish Lashio to the junta.[525]

In early December, the MNDAA declared a unilateral ceasefire and expressed willingness to engage in peace talks with the junta, with China acting as a mediator.[526] The MNDAA announced its readiness to send a high-level delegation for dialogue to resolve conflicts through political means.[527] However, despite this announcement, airstrikes on TNLA-held areas continued.[528] On 20 January 2025, the MNDAA and the junta agreed to a Chinese-brokered ceasefire, with several sources claiming that a withdraw of the former from Lashio was a condition for the deal. However, at the time neither the junta nor the MNDAA revealed any details of the deal.[529] The pressure for MNDAA to retreat from Lashio continued but ceasefire talks failed in late March 2025.[516]

Renewed southern Shan assault [ edit ]

In early August, the PNLA launched a renewed assault on the outskirts of Hsi Hseng after junta forces in the town bombed the PNLA headquarters in Mawkmai Township.[530] At the same time, the junta-allied PNO intensified military preparations by training 10,000 militia members in Pinlaung Township, in southern Shan State, aimed at bolstering the defense of Naypyitaw.[531] On 10 September, the PNLO split after disputes surrounding a ceasefire with the junta, with pro-ceasefire leaders breaking off to form the ""PNLO-NCA-S.""[532]

On 19 September, the Tatmadaw and allied Lahu military attacked a Shan State Army (RCSS) base in Yanghkam, Mong Ping Township.[533]

Continued attacks in the Dry Zone [ edit ]

PDF forces in Magway Region, August 2024

The People's Defence Forces also continued fighting outside of the Shan-Man context. On 11 June the Union Liberation Front and Sagaing Region People's Defence Organisation captured a junta base near the Sagaing capital Monywa.[534] On 27 June, a coalition of several PDFs attacked Budalin.[535]

On 17 July, People's Defense Forces launched 2 rockets at Nay Pyi Taw International Airport, causing no casualties.[536]

On 10 August, PDFs in Myingyan District, central Mandalay Region, launched an offensive against Taungtha and Natogyi.[537] Natogyi was briefly captured before being recaptured by the junta soon after. On 15 August, PDF launched an offensive on Tabayin, Sagaing Region, again capturing the town by 18 August briefly before withdrawing shortly after due to junta counter attacks.[538] In mid-August, the KIA and PDF launched joint offensives on Indaw, Pinlebu, and Htigyaing, Sagain Region.[539] Resistance forces captured Pinlebu on 8 October, defeating almost 800 junta soldiers.[540]

On 11 November, the Burma National Revolutionary Army and several other PDF's launched attacks on Pale before being forced to retreat due to junta counter attacks.[541]

Late 2024 Kachin offensives [ edit ]

On 7 September, KIA forces began attacking Singtawn -outside Hpakant- after junta forces raided a hotel in the area, capturing the village one month later.[542] In late September, it was reported that junta forces were preparing an offensive to retake Sumprabum and Tiyangzug.[543]

On 29 September, the KIA launched an offensive on Chipwi and Hsawlaw, capturing both towns by 2 October. Shortly after, the KIA asked the Kachin Border Guard Forces to defect, but were denied.[544] In response, the KIA launched an offensive on Kachin BGF battalions 1002 and 1003, capturing both by 22 October.[545][546]

Pang War, Myanmar on a snowy day

The KIA then captured the Kachin BGF's headquarters in the town of Pang War on 20 October with Kachin BGF leader Zahkung Ting Ying fled to China.[547] On 1 November, the KIA launched an attack on the final BGF 1001 bases at Nuzaungbaung and Phimaw, capturing both by the next day. Border Guard Forces fled to Kangfang (Ganfai), which the KIA captured days later.[548] On 10 November, KIA forces completed the capture of Kachin Special Region 1 and all of the Kachin BGF territory when they took Lanse village.[549] On 20 November, despite Chinese pressure not to, the KIA captured Kanpaikti, the final Kachin BGF base.[550]

In December, the KIA and allies attacked Myanmar junta targets in Bhamo and Mansi townships.[551]

Chin theatre [ edit ]

In early August, the Chin National Army and allies took in Thantlang after about a week of fighting.[552]

On 9 November, the Chin Brotherhood Alliance relaunched Operation Chin Brotherhood, launching simultaneous offensives on Falam and Mindat, capturing most of the former.[553]

In December 2024, the Chin Brotherhood Alliance (CBA) achieved significant victories in Chin State. On 15 December, 123 junta troops and police officers from Mindat district and township police compounds, together with their families, surrendered to the CBA.[554] On 21 December, the CBA declared Mindat a junta-free zone following the rescue of 13 political prisoners.[555] These victories further consolidated the CBA's control in the region and demonstrated the strength of Operation Chin Brotherhood.

Advances in Rakhine and the fall of Ann [ edit ]

On 20 December 2024, the Arakan Army (AA) claimed to have captured the Myanmar military's Western Command headquarters in Ann, Rakhine State.

After the capture of Thandwe, Arakan Army forces launched an offensive south towards Gwa, capturing Kyeintali by 14 August.[556] On 5 September, the AA captured Maung Shwe Lay Naval Base, the first naval base to be captured by resistance forces.[557] On 25 September, the AA launched an offensive on the remaining bases in Ann. By 25 October, the AA captured the remaining Mae Taung bases, encircled Ann, and captured the town's airport.[558] On 7 November, the AA launched an offensive on neighboring Taungup.[559] The Arakan Army captured Maungdaw in the first half of December, after securing the Junta's last remaining position there. The AA captured General Thurein Tun during the operation.[560][561]

In December 2024, the AA achieved significant victories in Rakhine State. On December 8, the AA captured Maungdaw Township, securing full control over the 271-kilometer border with Bangladesh.[562] This strategic gain was followed by the seizure of the Western Regional Command headquarters in Ann Township on December 20, marking the second regional command center to fall to ethnic armed groups within five months.[563] On December 29, the AA extended its campaign by seizing full control of Gwa Township, the southernmost town in Rakhine State, after junta troops retreated from the area.[564] This victory further consolidated the AA's dominance in the region, leaving only a few townships under junta control.[565] The AA's leadership has since expressed readiness to engage in political dialogue to seek resolution to the ongoing conflict.[566]

In January 2025, Arakan Army and joint PDF forces pushed into Shwethaungyan Subtownship, northwest Ayeyarwaddy Region taking the village of Magyizin.[567] Battle with the junta intensified in the area as the Myanmar Navy increased bombardments to the Bawmi coastline area near Magyizin by 20 January 2025.[568] By late March, AA had reached the eastern side of the Arakan mountains taking villages in Lemyethna Township near the Pathein-Monywa Highway.[569]

Karen State clashes and key KNLA advances [ edit ]

After the Karen National Army set a five-month deadline in May 2024 for Chinese scamming operatives to leave Myawaddy, many have migrated to the Three Pagodas Pass, controlled by the Democratic Karen Benevolent Army.[570] Throughout May, the KNLA, aided by allies, captured all but three of the remaining junta bases in Hpapun Township.[571]

On 1 June, clashes erupted between KNLA-led forces and joint Karen National Army/junta forces near Tonetatdar. A source close to the junta claimed that Karen National Army (KNA) soldiers were coordinating to join with junta soldiers from Operation Aung Zeya to retake Myawaddy, Thingannyinaung and to attack the Asian Highway 1 (AH1).[572] However, after being stalled for months by ambushes on the AH1, the Aung Zeya column was forced to retreat to Kawkareik.[573]

On 9 August, KNLA forces clashed with junta reinforcements near Zayatkyi, Htantabin Township.[574]

In December 2024, the KNLA achieved significant victories in Kayin State. On December 17, the KNLA attacked the Swe Taw Kone junta camp near Lay Kay Kaw village, capturing prisoners and seizing weapons.[575] Additionally, the KNLA recaptured its former headquarters, Manerplaw, on the Thai border, further consolidating its control in the region.[576]

Shifting Karenni frontlines [ edit ]

In early August, the Tatmadaw and civilian sources reported that the Tatmadaw had secured Loikaw and much of the surrounding township.[577] On 5 September, the KNDF attempted to assassinate Tatmadaw leader Min Aung Hlaing while he was visiting Loikaw.[578]

As of September 20, 2024, the Myanmar junta only had control of Loikaw and Bawlakhe Townships.[579]

During October, fighting shifted to North Kayah State, after the flooding of Typhoon Yagi. Tatmadaw troops and Pa-O militia attacked several Karenni Resistance-held settlements including Pinlaung, Mobye and Pekon.[580] Pekon was taken in a military counter-offensive taking advantage of the flooding caused by Yagi.[581] However, Karenni leadership believes that the Tatmadaw does not aim to hold the territory, only to shore up its supply lines[582] as the Tatmadaw has to use helicopters to maintain some supply lines.[583] While fighting was reported early December along Pekon-Moebye-Loikaw road.[584]

On 29 October, it was announced that several Karenni resistance groups united to form the Kayan National Army.[585]

In January 2025, El País reported that Demoso has become a major center for refugees, housing some 150,000 displaced civilians.[586]

Fighting over Mobye [ edit ]

Tatmadaw has succeeded in taking Mobye, the town, during its offensive in December. Now as of early February the KNDF launches an advance to retake the town.[14]

Early March, reports of air and artillery strikes in Pekhon and Loikaw.[587] ""Heavy Clashes"" repoted in Mobye.[588] While KNDF had announced it launched an offensive to retake Mobye from Tatmadaw, who had taken it in December.[14] Junta is reported to have taken high casualties when taking the town. With KNDF now defending against a Junta bid to ""Reclaim"" Mobye from KNDF. The Junta is now sending reinforcements from Loikaw to help in this effort. Additional areas are mentioned, with the Irrawaddy citing an KNDF member saying: ""Fighting has also broken out in [Karenni’s] Loikaw, Hpasaung, and Bawlakhae townships over the past month, but Mobye has seen the heaviest clashes. The junta has suffered significant casualties while we have also lost some comrades"". Mobye is strategically located 40 km from Loikaw.[589]

This article is about the ongoing civil war. For the nonviolent protests, see Myanmar protests (2021–present)

The Myanmar civil war (Burmese: မြန်မာ့ပြည်တွင်းစစ်),[o] also known as the Burmese civil war, is an ongoing civil war since 2021. It began following Myanmar's long-running insurgencies, which escalated significantly in response to the 2021 coup d'état and the subsequent violent crackdown on anti-coup protests.[33][34] The exiled National Unity Government (NUG) and major ethnic armed organisations repudiated the 2008 Constitution and called instead for a democratic federal state.[35] Besides engaging this alliance, the ruling government of the State Administration Council (SAC), also contends with other anti-SAC forces in areas under its control.[36] The insurgents are apportioned into hundreds of armed groups scattered across the country.[37]

As of March 2023 the United Nations estimated that since the coup in February 2021, 17.6 million people in Myanmar required humanitarian assistance, while 1.6 million were internally displaced, and over 55,000 civilian buildings had been destroyed.[38] The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) said that over 40,000 people had fled into neighboring countries, such as Bangladesh, India and Thailand.[39]

As of October 2023, Myanmar's military, the Tatmadaw, controlled under 40% of the country, although they maintained that they controlled around two-thirds of the country's 330 townships.[40][41][42] In the second half of 2023, Chinland Defense Forces in Chin State had captured a majority of the state, with a few holdouts in urban areas and along the India–Myanmar border remaining. In October 2023, the Tatmadaw began facing manpower issues, with desertions and low morale being extremely common. This coincided with a major offensive by the People's Defense Force and Three Brotherhood Alliance in the west of the country, which was successful in taking 80 bases, 220 SAC positions and several towns by 28 November 2023.[43]

October and November 2023 saw a series of concurrent anti-SAC offensives, including Operation 1111 besieging the state capital of Loikaw and renewed conflict by anti-SAC forces in northern Rakhine and Chin states.[44][45] In Operation 1027, anti-SAC forces seized Laukkai, the capital of Kokang Self-Administered Zone, in early January 2024.[46] Northern Shan State fighting stopped with the Haigeng ceasefire after the fall of Laukkai. The Rakhine offensive, however, continued in northern Rakhine state with Mrauk U, among others, falling to the Arakan Army in February 2024.[47] As of February 2024, thousands of the SAC's soldiers have surrendered without a fight, including six generals of the Tatmadaw.[48] The SAC has used terror tactics against the population, including burnings, beheadings, mutilations, war rape, torching villages, and a massive aerial bombing campaign that has displaced nearly 3 million people.[49] The Myanmar Air Force has dropped more bombs per capita than have been dropped in the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[37] A group of observers write that the SAC's forces remain ""formidable and well-equipped"", with ""external allies and economic resources"".[50][51]

In late March 2024 anti-SAC forces in southeastern Myanmar captured Demoso and Papun,[52][53] bringing the number of district-level towns captured by anti-SAC forces up to eight. The ninth district-level town, Matupi, was captured by Chin resistance in mid June 2024.[54] In late June 2024 the Three Brotherhood Alliance restarted Operation 1027 after claiming that Tatmadaw forces had broken the ceasefire, capturing the tenth district level town, Kyaukme, by the end of the month.[55] On 17 July, two more district level towns were captured by the Brotherhood Alliance, Thandwe and Mongmit, bringing the number up to twelve.[56] On 3 August, the MNDAA as part of a wider effort from the Three Brotherhood Alliance and other resistance groups captured Lashio, the largest town in northern Shan State, as well as the headquarters of the SAC's Northeastern Command.[57] On 20 December 2024, the Arakan Army (AA) claimed to have captured the Myanmar military's Western Command headquarters in Ann, Rakhine State, marking the second regional command to fall to ethnic rebels in five months.[58]

After the deadly 2025 Myanmar earthquake, the NUG declared a two week pause on offensives,[59] and the SAC announced a ceasefire from 2 April to 22 April,[60] despite continuing airstrikes on rebel groups.[61]

Background [ edit ]

Internal conflict in Myanmar [ edit ]

Map of insurgent activity in Burma in 1948 (top) and 1953 (bottom)

Insurgencies have been ongoing in Myanmar since 1948 and have largely been ethnic-based. Communists and the Karen National Union were the primary opposition actors to the central government.[62][63] Over the 20th century, several prominent ethnic armed organizations (EAOs) rose and fell in influence and control. Larger rebel factions such as the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) formed in response to Ne Win's 1962 coup d'état and its increased political repression.[64] The 8888 Uprising, in response to the one party dominated rule of Ne Win, resulted in some of the first modern Bamar militias forming from protestors heading to areas under ethnic rebel control.[65]

In the aftermath of the 8888 Uprising the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), later known as the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), formed a Tatmadaw-led council. Myanmar's military, better known as the Tatmadaw, severely weakened ethnic insurgent groups, destroying most of their bases and strongholds through the 1990s.[66] By the time of the 2011–2015 Myanmar political reforms, the Tatmadaw had regained control of many long-time rebel strongholds including Kokang and Karen State.[67][68]

The 2008 Constitution created self-administered zones with increased autonomy as part of its reforms. In 2015, the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA) was signed between eight EAOs and the central government.[69] However, by 2018 the NCA began to fall apart, due to alleged violations of the agreement by Tatmadaw soldiers entering EAO territories to build roads.[70] Many non-signatories continued the conflict. In late 2016, four non-signatories of the NCA formed the Northern Alliance, including the KIA and Arakan Army, engaged in war with the central government and other EAOs.[71]

2021 Myanmar coup d'état and protests [ edit ]

On the morning of 1 February 2021, the Tatmadaw successfully deposed the elected Myanmar government in a coup, forming a State Administration Council. Former president Win Myint, state chancellor Aung San Suu Kyi, and several other members of the National League for Democracy were detained during the early morning of February 1. Min Aung Hlaing was installed as the Commander-in-Chief of Defense Services and de facto ruler of the nation.[72]

The established motives behind the coup are unclear. In the leadup to the coup, the Tatmadaw claimed that the 2020 general elections had 8.6 million voter irregularities, but presented no evidence. The coup may have been a way to re-establish the military's long-reigning power over the country which ended ten years prior.[73]

The bloody repression of anti-coup demonstrations led to the creation of armed groups to fight the State Administration Council (SAC). Gathered under the name of the People's Defense Force (PDF) and the orders of the National Unity Government (NUG), formed by parliamentarians in office before the coup d'état, the PDF and the NUG officially declared a ""defensive war"" against the SAC rule in September 2021.[74] The ACLED estimated that as of 29 July 2022, around 23,521 people in total had been killed in the violence following the 2021 coup.[75]

In the months following the coup, the opposition began to coalesce around the National Unity Government, which launched an offensive against the SAC. By 2022, the opposition controlled substantial, though sparsely populated, territory.[77][78][79] In many villages and towns, the SAC's attacks drove out tens of thousands of people. On the second anniversary of the coup, in February 2023, the chairman of the SAC, Min Aung Hlaing, admitted to losing stable control over ""more than a third"" of townships. Independent observers note the real number is likely far higher, with as few as 72 out of 330 townships remaining under the control of the Tatmadaw, the military forces aligned with the junta. However, the townships under the control of the SAC still included all major population centres.[80]

Prelude [ edit ]

Armed protesters [ edit ]

By late March 2021, dozens of protesters had travelled to Myanmar's border areas to enlist in and train under one of the country's many insurgent groups,[81] elevating the risk of a countrywide civil war.[82] The Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH) also proposed the formation of a ""Federal Armed Force"" to combat the military,[83] and in late March the Arakan Army (AA) threatened to end its ceasefire with the military should the latter ""persist in massacring civilians"".[84]

During late March, protesters increasingly began arming themselves with homemade weapons in an attempt to defend themselves against attacks by the military. Clashes with soldiers and IED attacks against administrative buildings and police stations became more common and protesters slowly became armed resistance.[85]

After about thirty years of dormancy, the People's Liberation Army (PLA), the armed wing of the Communist Party of Burma (CPB), became active again on 15 March 2021 when communist fighters crossed from China into Kachin State where the Kachin Independence Army would provide them weapons.[86] and by August 2021, the CPB established a new armed wing to fight against the SAC.[87] Over the next two years, the PLA would grow its presence in Tanintharyi Region, where they fight alongside the PDF, claiming to have 1,000 active troops in December 2023.[88]

Renewed ethnic conflict [ edit ]

The unrest across the nation and the increased need for SAC troops in previously peaceful urban areas strengthened EAOs. The Kachin Independence Army had already been on the offensive since February and seized the military's base of Alaw Bum near the town of Laiza on 25 March 2021.[89] The next day, the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA) attacked a military base, killing 10 SAC soldiers and taking others hostage in their first attack since the protests began.[90] The following day saw the 2021 Kalay clashes where protestors openly used homemade weapons against soldiers for the first time, targeting security forces attacking a protest camp.[91]

SAC declared that it would cease all military operations on 29 March 2021 and hold bilateral negotiations with ethnic armed groups. However, the Kachin Independence Army continued its offensives, stating that the Myanmar Army had not in fact ceased operations.[89] Seven insurgent groups who were signatories to the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement aligned themselves with the National Unity Government (NUG), including the All Burma Student Democratic Front (ABSDF) and the Karen National Union (KNU).[92] The Northern Alliance, comprising the Arakan Army, the Ta'ang National Liberation Army and the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, attacked a police station in Naungmon, Shan State, killing at least 10 police officers and indicating their disregard of the SAC's call for a ceasefire.[93] In response, on 11 April 2021, the junta military launched a counter-attack to recapture the Alaw Bum base using airstrikes and ground troops, but had to retreat amidst heavy casualties.[94]

On 26 April, the Battle of Mindat became one of the first large-scale conflicts arising from the 2021 coup. The Chinland Defense Force (CDF) began armed resistance in Mindat, Chin State and the SAC declared martial law.[95] After a soldier allegedly fired at protestors, fighting between the two sides erupted.[96] The battle lasted four days, killing 30 SAC soldiers and left Mindat abandoned as more than 10,000 people fled the area.[97]

Timeline [ edit ]

Onset of formal resistance and war (May 2021 – August 2021) [ edit ]

On 16 April 2021, pro-democracy politician Min Ko Naing announced the formation of the National Unity Government, with members of ethnic minority groups in senior roles. As part of the announcement he said that ousted leaders Aung San Suu Kyi and Win Myint would retain their positions and asked the international community to recognize their government over the SAC.[98][99] Throughout April, informal clashes with protestors intensified, such as in Taze when protesters fought back against soldiers with hunting rifles and firebombs on 8 April.[100]

The National Unity Government then declared the formation of an armed wing, the People's Defence Force (PDF) – on 5 May 2021, a date that is often cited as the start of the civil war. The PDF was formed to protect its supporters from SAC attacks and as a first step towards a Federal Union Army.[101] The PDF clashed with the Tatmadaw in the town of Muse on 23 May, killing at least 13 members of Myanmar's security forces.[102]

The Karen National Liberation Army attacked the SAC base on June 14, 2021.

In early June, fighting erupted in Myawaddy District where the military and Karen Border Guard Forces battled against a combined Karen and PDF force, leaving dozens of SAC troops killed.[103] Members of the Karenni PDF in Kayah State also captured and destroyed several Tatmadaw outposts near the state capital, Loikaw.[104] Towards the end of May, the Tatmadaw used artillery and helicopters to strike PDF positions in Loikaw and Demoso.[105] On 30 May, the KIA joined the PDF in a battle against SAC troops in Katha Township, killing eight SAC soldiers. Fighting also sprouted up in other Kachin State townships, including Putao, Hpakant and Momauk.[106]

While there were fewer conflict deaths between May and September, there were still many armed clashes and a spike in early June.[107] Two dozen local officials appointed by the military were assassinated throughout the month of June with hundreds of bombings at police stations, banks and government offices.[108] On 22 June, SAC forces using armoured vehicles raided a safehouse of the PDF in Mandalay, detaining several fighters.[109] Myanmar security forces killed at least 25 people in another raid in Tabayin.[110] These attacks occurred in Central Myanmar, also known as Anya, an area that had rarely seen armed violence in recent times.[111] On 2 July, troops assaulted several villages in Sagaing Region and reportedly killed 41 civilians. The Washington Post described how Myanmar was sliding toward ""bloody anarchy"".[108]

Declaration of war [ edit ]

On 7 September 2021, the NUG declared a state of emergency across the nation and launched what they called the ""people's defensive war"" against the SAC.[112][113] The declaration of war increased the number of skirmishes and clashes between PDF militias, EAOs and the SAC across the country.[114] According to the NUG in September 2021, over 1,700 SAC soldiers had been killed and 630 wounded in fighting during the preceding three months.[115] Several major clashes took place from September to October in Chin State, Sagaing Region, Magwe Region, Kayah State and Shan State.[116][117]

On 18 September, the Pa-O National Army, a pro-SAC militia active in the Pa-O Self-Administered Zone, aided the SAC in capturing a resistance base near Aungban.[118]

By late September 2021, 8,000 residents of Thantlang town, Chin state, fled to Mizoram, India after their houses were set ablaze by the SAC army.[119] Ambushes by anti-SAC forces in Shan State also killed at least 20 soldiers.[120] On 16 November 2021, SAC forces overran and captured the base camp of Kalay PDF in southwestern Sagaing Region, killing 2 fighters and capturing 9 Kalay PDF medics.[121]

In October, SAC-controlled media reported that at least 406 junta informants had been killed and 285 wounded since 1 February in targeted attacks by resistance forces.[122]

Initial conflict (September 2021 – August 2022) [ edit ]

2021–2022 dry season campaigns [ edit ]

According to analyst Matthew Arnold, the civil war's momentum passed critical threshold by the end of the 2022 dry season where the revolutionary sentiment had grown into a broader social and armed resistance that the SAC could no longer suppress.[123] Towards the end of 2021, direct armed clashes gave way to more bombings, explosive devices and landmines. The PDF, with strong ground support from local communities, attacked soft government targets like police stations, outposts and military-owned businesses. Through these, the resistance became more organised as they seized weapons, underwent training and communicated between units through the help of the NUG and allied EAOs.[107] According to the Karen National Union, roughly 2,200 SAC soldiers and militiamen were killed in the first half of 2022.[124]

South-eastern Myanmar [ edit ]

On 17 November 2021, dozens of SAC soldiers ambushed an outpost of the Moebye PDF in Pekon Township, Shan State, forcing the outnumbered PDF soldiers to retreat.[125] At least four SAC soldiers were killed during a four-day clash in Hpruso Township with the KNDF and Karenni Army.[126]

On 14 December, around 200 Tatmadaw troops searched the Karen National Union (KNU)-controlled town of Lay Kay Kaw Myothit near the Thai border, arresting people suspected to be activists or members of the PDF.[127] On 20 December, SAC forces burned down nineteen houses in Kunnar, Loikaw Township after taking it from the KNDF the week before.[128]

On 24 December, more than 35 people were massacred when they were ambushed by SAC troops outside the village of Mo So in Kayah State.[129] Two staff members of the aid group Save the Children were among those killed.[130] The United Nations Security Council condemned the attack and called for a ""thorough and transparent investigation"" into the incident.[131][132]

Throughout February and March 2022, the SAC carried out repeated air strikes against civilian targets in villages in Shan, Kayin and Kayah States. On 17 February alone, around 20 SAC soldiers and 20 resistance fighters were killed in clashes in Mobye, southern Shan State.[133] Witnesses described soldiers systematically looting jewelry, cash, vehicles, and other valuables. Amnesty International reported these actions as collective punishment against the country's ethnic minorities.[134]

Fighting broke out in parts of Loikaw on 14 April.[135] The number of refugees on the Thai border increased after increased combat in Kayin State.[136] On 15 April, SAC soldiers suffered at least 30 casualties after being pushed back by the KNLA at the battle for Lay Kay Kaw.[137]

Central Myanmar [ edit ]

The Dry Zone historical heartland of Myanmar had rarely seen armed violence in the modern conflict in Myanmar since 1948 as a predominantly Buddhist and Bamar farming region. The fighting in the Anya theater of Central Myanmar starting in 2021 changed this trajectory. Without the presence of EAOs, the Bamar PDF groups are characterized as local cells acting autonomously towards simple and directed towards the 2021 coup. In the 2021–2022 dry season, the PDFs began to work more closely together and coordinate towards larger goals.[138] In early 2022, resistance forces were fighting in Monywa, the capital of Sagaing Region.[139] Resistance attacks on the SAC saw the SAC retaliate on civilians[140] Targeted personnel attacks increased, killing various SAC personnel and destroying equipment.[141] The PDF also suffered losses, with 12 fighters killed in a battle in Khin-U Township.[142] Many cities saw violent clashes during 2022's Union Day.[143] Mandalay also saw fighting, with casualties on both sides.[144]

Northern Myanmar [ edit ]

Throughout the 2021–2022 dry season, various groups in Northern Myanmar carried out ambushes against military outposts and convoys. The Kachin Independence Army (KIA) and the PDF attacked convoys in Mohnyin[145] and Hpakant townships.[146] In October, they also partially shut down gold mining operations run by SAC allies.[147] After an ambush near Shwegu, the Tatmadaw responded with airstrikes and ground attacks against KIA bases in Hpakant and Mohnyin Townships.[148] In early February, the KIA assaulted several military bases in Kachin and Shan States, reportedly burning one in Hpakant Township down. The SAC responded by increasing airstrikes and send reinforcements to the area.[149]

The Chinland Defense Force (CDF) and the Chin National Army (CNA) raided and ambushed outposts and convoys in Matupi[150] and Mindat Townships.[151] In December, the Tatmadaw recaptured the town of Thantlang from the CDF in an offensive that destroyed over a quarter of the town's buildings.[152]

On 14 January 2022, units of the CNA moved into Senam village, south of Tamu, in neighboring Sagaing Region to attack a base run by the Indian-based People's Liberation Army of Manipur. After several hours of fighting, between 10 and 20 Manipuri rebels and 1 CNA fighter were killed.[153]

Yangon and other regions [ edit ]

During this time, there were several cases of guerilla warfare across Myanmar using homemade explosives, including several accidents killing resistance fighters. On 17 June 2021, an army vehicle exploded in Tamwe Township, Yangon, allegedly killing several military personnel.[154] On 14 December, Tatmadaw troops captured 12 suspected resistance fighters after several bombs accidentally exploded in Hlaing Thar Yar Township, Yangon.[155] Urban warfare became less practical, so resistance forces began targeting SAC-aligned officials. According to SAC-aligned sources, 367 SAC-appointed officials were assassinated in targeted attacks between February 2021 and February 2022.[156] Resistance forces also began targeting the homes of SAC pilots in Yangon in response to airstrikes on civilians.[157]

Fighting also occurred in other Bamar-majority regions. On 31 January 2022, at least 36 SAC soldiers were reportedly killed in ambushes over three days in Magwe, Sagaing and Tanintharyi regions and Chin, Shan and Kayah states.[158]

2022 monsoon decrease in intensity [ edit ]

The intensity of fighting decreased during the monsoon season.[114] Resistance forces were advantaged by the rainfall as the SAC could not carry out air strikes as easily.[159] In June, resistance groups achieved control of 40–50% of the country. Arakan Army claimed to administer most of Rakhine State with an independent government. Chin National Front and CDF made plans to establish a new government. The KIA and the Wa State, a neutral de-facto independent region of Myanmar, consolidated expanded territories.[160] However, the Myanmar Army retained tight control of almost every city in Myanmar and most of the country's natural resources, including important jade mines.[161] During this time, the PDF were also unable to move beyond rural guerilla tactics. Duwa Lashi La, acting president of the NUG, cited the lack of weaponry and international support as reasons for the prolonged conflict.[77]

On 31 May 2022, a bombing killed one person and injured nine others near the Sule Pagoda in Yangon, the largest city in Myanmar. State media accused the People's Defence Force of being responsible for the attack, which the PDF denied.[162] A July clash in Pekon Township, Shan State also killed around 40 SAC soldiers and 11 PDF fighters.[163]

Massacres and executions [ edit ]

The military deployed its time-tested counterinsurgency methods in what has been called a ""hammer approach"" of bombing and burning villages and massacring civilians to flush out rebel groups. However, the approach was ineffective because they were unable to consolidate power or deter the resistance.[77]

Myanmar military forces executed at least 37 villagers in the Mon Taing Pin massacre in May 2022 after shelling the village of Mondaingbin, Sagaing Region with heavy artillery.[164] The SAC forces entered the local Buddhist monastery, conscripted young male villagers briefly before executing them and other captives by a stupa.[165]

On 23 July 2022, the State Administration Council announced that it had executed four political prisoners, including Zayar Thaw and Kyaw Min Yu, which was the first use of capital punishment in Myanmar since the late 1980s.[166] The men had been accused of helping the resistance movement.[167] The event was widely seen as a provocation to escalate the ongoing conflict by the Tatmadaw.[168] The international community, including United Nations Secretary-General, the G7 nations and the European Union strongly condemned the executions.[169][167]

According to a special report from Radio Free Asia, SAC soldiers following a raid in Kachin state's Se Zin village in August 2022, set fire to more than 400 homes with at least 15 people killed on the spot, detained some 400 people in and around Se Zin, and about 100 of them have been killed (including extrajudicial massacre) by security forces between August 2022 and January 2023 while others died due to horrific prison conditions.[170]

On 16 September 2022, the Burmese military killed 11 children and wounded another 17 in the Let Yet Kone massacre, as part of an airborne strike conducted against a school in Let Yet Kone, Sagaing Region.[171] The military claimed that the village was harbouring resistance fighters from the KIA and PDF.[172] The attack was widely condemned by the international community, including the United Nations and European Union.[173][174]

Later in September 2022, retired Brigadier General Ohn Thwin, mentor to State Administration Council vice-chairman Senior General Soe Win, was assassinated by anti-SAC guerilla groups in Yangon. This assassination caused an increase in security on high-ranking SAC personnel.[175]

Breakdown of Arakan ceasefire, monsoon 2022 [ edit ]

In early 2022, the Arakan Army and the junta clashed again in northern Rakhine State. On 8 February, Arakan Army and junta forces clashed on at least two occasions in Maungdaw in Rakhine State. Fighting broke out on 4 February when junta troops carried out a sneak attack on an AA outpost near the Letpan Mountains northeast of Mee Taik Village, killing an AA sentry, according to AA spokesman Khaing Thukha. Three hours of clashes were also reported on 6 February. The clashes raised fears of a breakdown of the informal ceasefire between the AA and the military which had been in place since November 2020.[176] Further clashes in northern Maungdaw on the night of 7 February killed two civilians.[177] Several junta troops, including a major, were also killed in the attack.[178]

The Bangladesh-Myanmar border

Between June and August 2022, the informal ceasefire reached in late 2020 between the Arakan Army (AA) and the junta broke down. The AA had consolidated control during this period, avoided the initial violence of the war, and introduced many public services and local administrators in northern Rakhine state. With the military's attention diverted to the increasing resistance elsewhere and increasing popular support for an alliance with the NUG, the AA sought to expand its influence into southern Rakhine.[179] Rhetoric from AA leader Twan Mrat Naing in June grew more provocative with military spokespeople stating that the AA was inviting conflict.[180] Armed clashes resumed in July after the junta launched an airstrike against an AA base in Kayin State, killing 6 AA soldiers. AA retaliated in Maungdaw Township and western Chin State in late July and early August. By late August, land travel to northern Rakhine required passing a series of checkpoints and all public transport ships ceased operation due to river and land blockades.[181]

On 16 August 2022, two mortar shells fired by the Myanmar Army landed in a Rohingya refugee camp in Bangladesh, killing one man and injuring five others. Myanmar Army helicopters allegedly entered Bangladeshi air space to attack the Arakan Army and fired a shell within Bangladeshi air space. Two days later, Bangladesh summoned Myanmar ambassador Aung Kyaw Moe to strongly protest the land and airspace violations.[182][183] In October 2022, Bangladeshi Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen made a statement that border bombings by Myanmar stopped after he met with the Chinese ambassador to Bangladesh, Li Jiming.[184]

Escalation of the civil war (September 2022 – November 2022) [ edit ]

Increased resistance efforts [ edit ]

In mid-October 2022, NUG issued a statement calling for the victory of the Spring Revolution by the end of 2023. This call to action was followed by increased fighting by the resistance forces in urban areas and in Southeastern Myanmar.[185] This development took place in the wake of the junta torching at least 20 villages in the Sagaing and Magway Regions as part of a ""four cuts"" strategy of attacking civilians to weaken anti-regime movements. According to Sagaing-based resistance spokespeople, many victims of arson then joined the resistance.[186] The urgency of the resistance was likely prompted by the looming elections planned by the State Administration Council.[185] The fragmentated nature of the grassroots elements of the PDF became more organized in 2022 through the command of the NUG and from cooperation with various EAOs- especially the Kachin Independence Army (KIA).[41]

The Karenni Nationalities Defense Force (KNDF) claimed in January 2023 that 1,692 regime troops and 211 resistance fighters were killed since the 2021 coup, 293 civilians had been killed by the regime, and 126 displaced civilians died while fleeing their homes in Kayah and Shan states in 2022.[187]

Highland attacks [ edit ]

A street in Kawkareik

The Karen National Liberation Army stepped up fighting, besieging the major town of Kawkareik on the Thai border in the 21 October 2022 Battle of Kawkareik.[185] The battle began with surprise attacks on the Asia Highway and at government offices within the town. Resistance forces looked poised to take the town, but ultimately withdrew two days later after facing junta air strikes and strategically drawing junta troops away from nearby positions.[188][189] Four days later, undeterred KNLA-led forces seized a junta Light Infantry Battalion base in Kyain Seikgyi Township.[190]

In Shan State, clashes between PDF forces near Inle Lake and the Pa-O National Organisation (PNO) broke out after the PNO coerced villages for speedboats and militia recruits.[191]

View of the Kalay-Falam Road

In late 2022, Chin State resistance forces used drones in a week-long siege of an outpost in Falam Township, killing 74% of the junta forces stationed, but failing to take the outpost against aerial bombardments.[192] In February 2023, CNA captured Thantlang police station and took control of the town.[193] In Kachin State, the Shanni Nationalities Army (SNA) became more actively allied with the junta as conflict between SNA and the KIA grew. In August, the SNA and the Myanmar Army set fire to hundreds of homes in Kachin state forcing KIA withdrawal from the area.[194]

Chin forces also targeted convoys on roads within the state. In March 2023, combined Chin resistance consisting of CNA, CNDF, and CDFs conducted multiple ambushes on a regime convoy between Kalay, Falam and Hakha capturing and destroyed multiple armoured vehicles.[195] The NUG awarded the combined Chin forces 400 million kyat for seizing two armoured vehicles.[196] The following day, the groups attacked another junta convoy carrying 80 troops on the road between Matupi and Paletwa, killing over 30 junta soldiers.[197] In April, CNDF attacked a junta base on the Kalay-Falam road near Varr, Falam Township, killing eleven regime soldiers and capturing fourteen.[198]

Lowland attacks [ edit ]

In November 2022, resistance in Bago Region increased. In Monyo Township, western Bago Region, the PDF attacked a police building using cluster bombs.[199] In eastern Bago, 15 junta soldiers were killed in a Bago PDF raid on a police station in Yedashe Township.[200] Thousands of civilians also fled Shwegyin Township as joint KNLA and NUG-led resistance forces seized three military outposts.[201]

A rural area near Mawlaik, Sagaing Region

In early December, a video of PDF forces beating and shooting a woman dead emerged on social media. The NUG Ministry of Defence said that the incident happened in June in Tamu, Sagaing and that they were investigating the incident after detaining the perpetrators involved.[202]

In early January 2023, PDF groups in Kani Township, Sagaing Region attacked junta supply ships, killing at least 25 soldiers. The junta increasingly used waterways for supplies, avoiding roadways in resistance-held areas.[203] In April 2023, a combined PDF force from nearby townships seized the Tower Taing hill base Kani Township, killing 30 junta soldiers and seizing weapons.[204][205]

In early 2023, the Mandalay PDF announced their intentions to ramp up military operations.[206] Alongside the TNLA, they engaged in a series of intense clashes with the junta forces in Nawnghkio Township near the Shan-Mandalay border, killing at least 75 junta soldiers and wounding 60 others.[207] A combined force of at least 900 junta and pro-junta militia troops attacked resistance positions with the help of artillery attacks and airstrikes during the clashes but were forced to retreat.[208]

Urban attacks [ edit ]

In 2023, the number of attacks in urban areas increased. In March 2023, the urban guerilla group Urban Owls assassinated Minn Tayzar Nyunt Tin, a legal and money-laundering aide to the junta with links to former Air Force commander General Myat Hein, in Thanlyin, Yangon. Minn Tayzar Nyunt Tin helped draft the repressive Cyber Security Law, which was seen as violating digital rights, privacy and freedom of expression.[209]

Junta retaliation and atrocities [ edit ]

In October 2022, battles and skirmishes increased, as the junta committed several civilian atrocities. On 21 October, junta forces decapitated Saw Tun Moe, a high school teacher from Thit Nyi Naung, and impaled his head on a NUG-administered school's spiked gate after burning and looting Taung Myint village in Magway Region.[210]

Two days later, on 23 October, over 80 people were killed by an airstrike in Hpakant Township, Northern Myanmar, during an anniversary celebration for the Kachin Independence Organisation (KIO). At least 80 civilians were killed, making it the single deadliest attack on civilians since the start of the renewed civil war.[211] The junta denied civilian casualties while the United Nations condemned the attack.[212]

In November 2022, the junta continued burning villages in Sagaing Region, including the home village of Cardinal Charles Maung Bo, the head of the Catholic Church in Myanmar.[213] Junta soldiers also hid in civilian trucks impersonating workers to ambush local defence forces in Shwebo Township.[214]

On 2 February 2023, Min Aung Hlaing imposed martial law in 37 townships with resistance activity, affecting millions of residents.[215]

Scorched earth tactics [ edit ]

In November 2022, the dry season allowed the greater use of the Myanmar Air Force to weaken resistance forces' ability to maintain strategic positions and outposts. Aerial bombardment, helicopter raids and artillery strikes typically followed skirmishes once junta ground forces sustained substantial losses and retreated. Once the entrapped forces were relieved by aerial support, they would engage in scorched earth tactics. World War Two veterans described the destruction as worse than that of the Burma campaign of World War II due to the deliberate targeting of civilian villages.[216] The heavy use of air forces came alongside a decrease in junta's ability to fight on the ground. During the week of 21 November, repeated junta air attacks along the Sagaing-Kachin border killed 80 and disrupted supply chains between the two resistance regions.[217] The junta's scorched earth campaign stretched across northern Myanmar, burning bases and villages they could no longer defend.[218] Thousands of residents fled during the campaign as hundreds of homes were destroyed.[219] In early 2023, one scorched earth push by the junta aimed to resecure the Letpadaung Copper Mine in Salingyi Township for Chinese foreign workers planning to leave for their holidays.[220]

On 23 February 2023, army troops launched a new military offensive in Sagaing, raiding and pillaging villages at the confluence of the Irrawaddy and Mu Rivers. During the offensive, troops from the 99th Light Infantry Division executed at least 17 villagers during the Tar Taing massacre.[221]

Temporary stalemate (November 2022 – September 2023) [ edit ]

November 2022 Arakan ceasefire [ edit ]

Fields in Maungdaw Township, northern Rakhine State

On 26 November 2022, the Arakan Army and the junta agreed to a temporary ceasefire starting on 27 November. The ceasefire was brokered by Yōhei Sasakawa of the Nippon Foundation. Arakan Army spokespeople maintained that they agreed to the ceasefire for humanitarian reasons, as opposed to international pressure. The Arakan Army did not withdraw from fortifications held at the time of the ceasefire.[222] Junta spokespeople said that this was the first step towards a permanent ceasefire with the Arakan Army.[223] As of mid-December, tensions remained high with forces from both sides remaining in deployment within northern Rakhine State.[224]

Subsequent new fronts [ edit ]

On 30 November, the military launched a major assault on the Kokang Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army using heavy weapons on a base near Chinshwehaw by the Chinese border. This assault continued into 2 December, reportedly sending 500 junta soldiers.[225]

The military continued its campaign in northern Shan State against the Ta'ang National Liberation Army (TNLA). On 7 December 2022, the junta launched a ground offensive on the TNLA in the Battle of Namhsan using aerial bombs.[226] After six days of fighting, the TNLA captured four villages from junta control, killing 70 soldiers and capturing 28. On 17 December, the junta retreated, claiming that they reached an agreement with TNLA, and that they intended to target the PDF forces and attacked the TNLA in mistake. The TNLA rejected the statement.[227] Continued clashes in late December forced over a thousand civilians to flee to Mogok.[228]

2023 guerrilla attacks [ edit ]

Burning Car in Lashio, April 2023

According to analysts in early 2023, the civil war was in a state of stalemate. Despite several successful engagements, there was still a significant disparity in power between the joint resistance forces and the junta. The PDF and EAOs faced resource constraints as they primarily relied on donations for funding and underground channels to acquire arms.[41] The resistance also increasingly used coordinated drone attacks, such as on 27 August 2023, when 11 resistance groups jointly conducted drone strikes in Sagaing Township, killing 17 soldiers.[229]

In early April, the Kawthoolei Army (KTLA) launched an offensive on the Karen State Border Guard Force (BGF)-held Shwe Kokko in retaliation for the imprisonment and killing of the group's spokesperson by the BGF. After the reported capture of 5 BGF bases,[230] by 8 April, the offensive began to stall. After junta/BGF counterattacks, the KTLA was forced to retreat, receiving heavy losses. Afterwards, the KNU stated that they did not approve these attacks, nor that they would accept the KTLA in their territory.[231]

In early June 2023, NUG announced the formation of the PDF's first battalion in Yangon Region – Battalion 5101.[232] On 19 June 2023, the Urban Owls guerilla group assassinated Ye Khaing, the operations director and head of security of Yangon International Airport, and a former air force major, outside his house at Mingaladon Township, Yangon. Ye Khaing was allegedly providing information to the junta and detaining anti-junta activists at Myanmar's primary international airport.[233] Urban Owls also claimed that Ye Khaing was a confidante of Steven Law, the owner of Asia World Company, which operates the airport, and is a major supporter of the regime together with the second-in-command, Senior General Soe Win.[234]

In late June 2023, a combined resistance force of PDF and KNLA took control of the National Highway 8 in Mon State, installing checkpoints and arresting junta personnel.[235] Also in June, the Ye Township-based resistance group Ye Belu launched successive guerrilla attacks on the junta in June 2023. On 22 June, they attacked a junta security checkpoint at Chaung Taung bridge, killing four soldiers and one official working for the junta's Ministry of Immigration and Population in Lamaing.[236] On 26 June, the group assassinated a Pyusawhti militia leader in Duya, Ye Township.[237] Two days later, they ambushed an army convoy from the junta's No. 19 Military Operations Command, killing five soldiers and injuring others.[238] The attacks caused a breakdown in junta administration in Ye Township. All administration offices in three towns – namely, Lamaing, Khawzar and Ye – closed down.[239]

On 10 August 2023, junta forces clashed with a coalition of several rebel groups at Thandaung, near Nay Pyi Taw. The rebel forces aimed to capture the 606th Light Infantry Division Headquarters.[240] On 15 September 2023, members of the Northern Thandaung Defence Force, along with the Lethal Prop drone unit, attacked the Aye Lar military base near the Nay Pyi Taw International Airport with 2 makeshift bombs. It was the first documented drone attack by resistance forces against an airbase.[241]

On 31 August and 9 September, the Zomi Revolutionary Army (ZRA) raided 2 Chinland Defense Force (CDF) outposts in Tonzang Township, killing 2 CDF soldiers. These attacks were not the first between the ZRA and Chin resistance, which have been clashing since 2021, and came despite the ZRA issuing a public statement of support for anti-junta resistance in 2021.[11]

2023 monsoon offensives [ edit ]

In August 2023, the NUG claimed that 3,012 junta troops were killed between January and July 2023.[242] In Kayah state alone, 667 military junta troops and 99 resistance members were killed.[242] In a September interview, Duwa Lashi La claimed that resistance forces had taken effective control of about 60% of Myanmar's territory.[243]

In early June 2023, a coalition force of KNLA and other resistance forces ambushed junta forces at Don Tha Mi bridge checkpoints on the border of Karen and Mon States, inflicting heavy casualties.[244] The next day, resistance groups raided the police station and junta offices in Kyain Seikgyi Township, Karen State, killing 10 junta soldiers and injuring 15. The junta retaliated with artillery fire and deployed attack helicopters, killing two local civilians and a monk.[244]

In Kayah State on 13 June 2023, the Karenni National People's Liberation Front (KNPLF), who had previously been in a ceasefire with the junta and became a Border Guard Force in 2009, openly defected to anti-junta forces. The KNPLF began attacking Burmese military positions, joining forces with KA, KNDF, KNLA, and PDF,[245] and seizing junta outposts in the Battle of Mese. The combined forces took over Mese Township in Eastern Kayah State.[246] 430 soldiers of the Light Infantry Battalion, including their lieutenant colonel commander, surrendered to the resistance.[247] Later in July, KNLA forces and allies captured the Lat Khat Taung hill junta base. During an attempt to recapture the hill, 20 junta soldiers were killed and 34 wounded.[248]

From July to September 2023, the Ta'ang National Liberation Army and the Mandalay People's Defence Force jointly conducted Operation Kanaung against junta forces in the Mandalay Region. Over that period, 76 junta soldiers were killed, 19 were wounded, and a large amount of weapons and ammunition were seized.[249][250]

Operation 1027 and concurrent offensives (October 2023 – January 2024) [ edit ]

Operation 1027 (Phase 1) [ edit ]

Map of anti-junta gains from Phase 1 of Operation 1027 as of 19 March 2024

On 27 October 2023, the Three Brotherhood Alliance initiated an offensive they called Operation 1027, targeting the junta's checkpoints and bases near Lashio and the Phaung Seik border trade post near Chinshwehaw.[251] Chinshwehaw fell into ethnic armies' hands. Lashio Airport and two important China-Myanmar border crossings near Laukkai were closed.[252][253] Over the next three days, the coalition forces captured 57 bases to which the junta responded with aerial bombardments.[254] Simultaneously, the AA engaged junta forces in Htigyaing Township, Sagaing Region.[255]

On 30 October, Nawnghkio fell under limited TNLA and Mandalay PDF control[256] and 41 junta combatants in Kunlong surrendered to the MNDAA.[257] The next day, combined AA and KIA forces captured Gangdau Yang base on the Myitkyina-Bhamo road.[258] A junta convoy came the next day to reinforce Nawnghkio but TNLA and PDF forces blew up an armored car, took weapons and POWs. The convoy retreated and established a camp in southwest Nawnghkio Township, which was assaulted by the rebel forces the following morning.[259] The junta acknowledged having lost control of three towns in Northern Shan State, including Pang Hseng.[260] TNLA, MNDAA, and AA declared control over four towns, including Hsenwi.[261]

TNLA captured the Shan State towns of Namhkam

On 6 November, TNLA forces seized bridges and road gates near Namhkam, Shan State, and took the town after a three-day assault.[262] Kawlin also fell to the coalition, marking the first district-level capital seized during the operation.[263] Over the next three days, the coalition took Khampat, Kunlong and Monekoe across northern Myanmar, re-establishing local government functions after securing towns.[264][265][266] They also took Panlong base in Kunlong Township, killing Brigadier General Aung Kyaw Lwin in the battle,[267] and the strategic Goktwin bridge near the Goteik viaduct on the main Mandalay-China highway.[268]

On 17 November, the TNLA captured the Sakhan Thit Kone base in Namhkam Township, but lost it to a junta offensive the following day. The TNLA accused the junta of using chemical weapon bombs during the counter-siege.[269] Through December, the TNLA seized Namhsan and Mantong taking over the Pa Laung Self-Administered Zone from junta control.[270][271]

On 29 November, the Shan State Progress Party (SSPP) and the Restoration Council of Shan State (RCSS) declared a truce between their respective armies in response to the Operation, with the SSPP stating that the 2 armies ""[intended] to unite as one in the future.""[272]

In early December, the Tatmadaw allegedly reached out to China for it to assert pressure on the Three Brotherhood Alliance to stop Operation 1027.[273] On 11 December, China helped to hold peace talks between the Tatmadaw and various rebel groups, including the Brotherhood Alliance.[274] The Brotherhood Alliance announced later on 13 December that these peace talks ""lasted only 10 minutes"" and vowed to continue fighting.[275]

In late January 2024, BBC News said that the ""bloody two-year stalemate"" of the civil war appears to ""have been broken"" with the success of the offense of the three ethnic armies in the Operation 1027 offense.[48]

Arakan Army offensive [ edit ]

On the morning of 13 November 2023, as part of Operation 1027, the Arakan Army (AA) attacked two Border Guard Police stations in Rathedaung Township, breaking the Rakhine State Ceasefire Agreement between the junta and the Arakan Army. Dong Paik camp was captured by 6:30 am.[45] On 14 November, the junta had already abandoned around 40 outposts in Rakhine state after attacks by the Arakan Army, but few came under their immediate control.[276] Dozens of Myanmar security officers surrendered to the Arakan Army the following day.[277]

On 14 November, the Arakan Army launched an offensive in Paletwa Township in neighbouring Chin State. The Arakan Army accused the Tatmadaw of using chemical weapons during the ensuing battles.[278]

The following night, the Arakan Army launched an attack on Pauktaw, seizing the township police station. By the next morning, the Arakan Army had taken control of the town. The junta sent two helicopter gunships alongside naval support to fire back, including at civilian housing, with heavy machine gun fire. Pauktaw's proximity to the Rakhine state capital, Sittwe, posed a threat to the junta.[279] Junta forces detained about 100 residents who were unable to flee, and positioned themselves to surround the town, using two navy ships to blockade the harbour.[280]

On 6 December, the Arakan Army would capture a major military base in the township.[281]

Battle of Laukkai [ edit ]

In late November and December, the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA) closed in on Laukkai, the capital of the Kokang Self-Administered Zone. They seized several strategic positions from junta forces during the ensuing Battle of Laukkai.[282] MNDAA forces attacked junta bases around the city in early December.[283] On 26 December, ninety junta soldiers surrendered to the MNDAA.[284] and, two days later, the artillery shelling of Laukkai would stop as the city mostly fell under MNDAA control.[285] On 5 January 2024, the MNDAA seized control of the junta battalion headquarters in Laukkai and gained full control of the city.[46]

A few days later, the Three Brotherhood Alliance claimed it had captured the towns of Kutkai and Theinni on 8 January after seizing junta military posts in the towns, including the headquarters of the 16th Military Operations Command in Theinni.[286] On 23 January, the Tatmadaw sentenced three of the brigadier generals who surrendered at Laukkai to death and the other three to life imprisonment, under military law.[287]

In the wake of these gains and the fall of Laukkai, on 12 January, China announced that it had negotiated another ceasefire between the junta and the 3BA, known as the ""Haigeng Agreement"".[288] The two sides agreed to disengage personnel and to not compromise the safety of Chinese border residents.[289] However, the following day, the TNLA reported that the junta had broken their agreement with airstrikes in Lashio Township and Kyaukme Township.[290]

Tatmadaw defensive response [ edit ]

The Irrawaddy reported on 22 November 2023 that the Tatmadaw was preparing 14,000 soldiers for the defence of Naypyitaw, including by moving troops from other regions to the capital and mobilizing civil servants into the military. These preparations started soon after Operation 1027 was launched against the Tatmadaw. In addition, the Tatmadaw was preparing 10,000 troops for the defence of Mandalay, Bago and Yangon. There were also fortification works beginning, with Naypyitaw police stations ""also preparing concrete blocks, sandbags and other materials needed to transform into defensive bases in just a few days"".[291]

Ronan Lee, a professor at Loughborough University, stated that the recent strategic reversals, nationwide territorial losses and economic decline meant momentum had strongly shifted away from Myanmar's junta, and the junta ""may now be in a death spiral"".[292]

Concurrent operations [ edit ]

Operation 1027 was supported by several concurrent operations by other anti-junta groups elsewhere in the country, including in the eastern regions Shan State and Kayah State. In northern Shan State, the KNLA and PDF clashed with the Tatmadaw around the town of Kawkareik in late October 2023.[293] In Mese Township (part of Kayah State), the KNPLF, KA and KNDF launched a joint military operation called Operation 1107 that captured several border posts starting on November 7.[294][295] Four days later, they launched the major Operation 1111 against Loikaw, the capital of Kayah State.[296] The military operations in Kayah displaced tens of thousands of civilians, especially from Loikaw.[297] After over a month of heavy fighting, rebel forces had won control of 85% of the capital.[298] Nonetheless, fighting has continued into January.[299] By late January, however, the offensive on Loikaw had mostly stalled.[300]

Other anti-junta forces launched Operation Taungthaman in Madaya Township, Mandalay Region. On 13 November, fighting erupted in Kinn Village, eastern Madaya Township between the TNLA and the junta, who responded with air and artillery strikes and later burning the village down.[301] By 28 November, PDF and TNLA forces captured a junta base in the township.[302] The TNLA additionally supported the operations with attacks in Nawnghkio and Kyaukme Townships in southern Shan State to cut off junta reinforcements.[303]

Chin offensive [ edit ]

On the morning of 13 November 2023, after two days of fighting, the Chin National Army (CNA) and local Chinland Defense Force (CDF) units, captured the town of Rikhawdar on the India–Myanmar border.[304] This marked the first town captured by resistance forces in Chin State since the coup. At least 40 junta soldiers and police officers fled to the Indian state of Mizoram, where they surrendered and were eventually repatriated.[305] The Chin National Defence Force (CNDF), took a junta camp on the Mizoram border two days later.[306] The following week on 21 November, local Zoland PDF units seized a military base on Kennedy Peak, the second highest mountain in Chin State.[307] Over the next week, CNA and its allies captured Lailenpi[308] and Rezua in Matupi Township.[309]

On 6 December 2023, the Chin National Front ratified the Chinland Constitution, proclaiming the state of Chinland.[310]

On 17 January 2024, the Taingen camp on the Falam road to the Indian border was captured, with Chin resistance forces seizing arms and ammunition.[311] On 20 January 2024, after more than 600 junta soldiers and refugees crossed the India–Myanmar border, the Government of India announced a plan to fence the entire border.[312]

New conflict landscape (January 2024–May 2024) [ edit ]

Following the fall of Laukkai and the junta facing serious threats by the Three Brotherhood Alliance, the war has turned into a more multipolar landscape with borderlands being seized by powerful anti-junta groups with significant implications for the foreign relations of Myanmar. Groups not a part of the alliance took advantage of the situation, but remained constrained by both tense relations and limited coordination.[313]

Rakhine offensive intensifies [ edit ]

Map of gains made by the Arakan Army since 2023

On 8 January 2024, the Arakan Army continued their offensive and captured the Taung Shey Taung base and its 200 junta soldiers in Kyauktaw Township, Rakhine State. On 15 January, the Arakan Army seized Paletwa, a strategic town for Indo-Myanmar infrastructure projects, and the entire township in Chin State.[314][315] A week later, the Arakan Army captured the town of Pauktaw in Rakhine State concluding a three-month battle.[316]

On 3 February 2024, as the clashes between Arakan Army and Tatmadaw increased in Rakhine, mortar shells and several bullets reportedly landed in Bangladesh territory, which injured some local residents near Ukhia, Cox's Bazar.[317] At least 229 Myanmar Border Guard Police (BGP) personnel entered Bangladesh seeking refuge from AA, where the Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) disarmed them.[318]

Between 4 February and 6 February, the Arakan Army launched attacks on Rakhine BGP outposts in Maungdaw Township, later alleging without providing evidence that the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army and Rohingya Solidarity Organisation (RSO) fought alongside the Rakhine BGP.[319] The RSO denounced AA's accusations and the AA labeling them as ""Bengalis"" among other issues.[319] Later in February when the junta began conscripting largely non-citizen displaced Rohingyas living in Kyaukphyu, the AA urged Rohingya people to flee into AA-controlled areas.[320]

Fall of Mrauk U [ edit ]

The Arakan Army captured most of the remaining Tatmadaw bases in Minbya Township by 6 February.[321] The Arakan Army captured Kyauktaw the next day and continued fighting in Mrauk U and Ramree.[322] The Tatmadaw abandoned Myebon to reinforce Kyaukphyu on 9 February, leaving ammunition behind in their rush and abandoning the southern township of Mrauk-U District.[323]

On 10 February, AA took the district capital town of Mrauk U completing their control over the township. During the battle, three Myanmar Navy landing craft were reportedly sunk.[47]

Over the next week, the Arakan Army consolidated control over the district capturing Myebon on 15 February[324] and capturing the remainder of Minbya Township on 28 February.[325]

New Shan State combatants [ edit ]

Southern Shan state mountains near Hopong

Early 2024 also saw a new theatre re-emerge in southern Shan state when, the Tatamadaw and the Pa-O National Army (PNA) attempted to confiscate the Pa-O National Liberation Army (PNLA)'s weapons on 20 January.[326] The PNLA, supported by KNDF and PDF forces, attacked Hsi Hseng eventually capturing the town on 26 January 2024.[327] The PNLA's political wing formally revoked their participation in the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement, pledged to help the NUG replace the Junta with a federal system and urged the PNA's political wing to defect.[6]

Between 21 January and 24 February, junta shelling killed 40 civilians in the Pa-O Self-Administered Zone, according local activists.[328] Towards the end of February, clashes between junta/PNA forces and PNLA forces broke out east of Hopong[329] and along the Taunggyi-Loilem road.[330] The junta regained control of Hsi Hseng by late March,[331] amid accusations of using chemical bombs according to the PNLA.[332]

Between 26 and 27 March the MNDAA and the Shan State Army (SSPP) clashed in Hseni Township after the alleged MNDAA bombing of SSPP camps.[333] On 3 May, the Shan State Progress Party announced that its armed forces would join revolutionary forces before retracting the statement two days later.[334] On 27 May, after a month of warnings, the TNLA began blockading several villages in Namhkam Township and detaining SSPP soldiers stationed in those villages. In response, the SSPP withdrew from camps in Hsenwi, Kutkai, and Pang Hseng.[335]

The United Nations voiced deep concern over renewed fighting in eastern Myanmar and allegations that the Myanmar armed forces employed heavy weapons against civilians, as well as abducted and forcibly recruited children in its ranks. Its Special Adviser on Prevention of Genocide and the Special Adviser on Responsibility to Protect also highlighted the responsibility of the military to protect all people.[336]

Junta counteroffensive in Anyar [ edit ]

Local People's Defense Forces guard an anti-SAC Junta Protest in Kani Township

Tatmadaw forces recaptured the district capital of Kawlin on 10 February after almost 10 days of fighting.[337] Junta forces razed the town, destroying the majority of homes in Kawlin and surrounding villages.[338] On 22 February, junta forces attempted to recapture the town of Maw Luu from the KIA and ABSDF.[339] On 14 March, junta forces took the village of Kampani, Kalay Township to weaken anti-junta attacks on Kalay.[340] Despite this campaign, on 16 March resistance forces captured the Pyusawhti-controlled village of Kyaung Taik north of Kalay.[341]

While the junta launched its counteroffensives, allied resistance launched an offensive to capture Kani, capturing around 80% of the town by 7 March.[342] After almost 10 days of fighting, by 15 March, rebels were forced retreat after overwhelming junta resistance.[343]

On 4 April 2024, the PDF launched an unprecedented drone attack against Aye Lar airbase, the main Tatmadaw headquarters, and Min Aung Hlaing's residence in the capital, Naypyidaw. Almost 30 drones were deployed; junta forces claimed 7 were shot down[344] while Myawaddy TV said 13 fixed-wing drones were shot down and there were no casualties or damage to property. NUG claimed the attack was ""a success"".[345] On 12 April, local People's Defense Forces claimed that they killed over a dozen junta soldiers in another attack on Aye Lar Airbase.[346]

On 19 April junta forces launched a counteroffensive to retake Shwe Pyi Aye, Homalin Township, after it was captured in November 2023.[347]

Junta control of Karen weakens [ edit ]

After Operation 1027 and the Battle of Kawkareik in October 2023, the KNLA continued to make gains throughout Karen State, Mon State, Bago Region, and Tanintharyi Region.[348] On 29 January 2024, KNLA and PDF forces shot down a Tatmadaw Eurocopter AS365, killing Brigadier General Aye Min Naung of the 44th Light Infantry Division.[349] In late February, PDF and KNLA forces took most of Myitta, Tanintharyi Region.[350] By 29 February, KNLA and aligned forces captured half of Kawkareik township, gaining fire control over the Myawaddy-Kawkareik highway.[351] The KNLA continued gaining pushing east on the highway,[352] capturing the Hpu Lu Gyi camp, south of Myawaddy, after a ""five minute fight"". This camp held both strategic and moral significance as the historic staging point for attacks on Manerplaw and Kawmoora after the junta captured it in 1990.[353] The next day, KNLA forces captured a junta base in Kyaikdon.[354] Fighting also broke out in KNLA 7th Brigade territory near Methawaw, forcing a junta retreat.[355]

Tensions also rose between the junta and the Karen State Border Guard Force (BGF), who refused orders to engage in battle and withdrew from their bases in Papun.[356] On 23 January, deputy commander-in-chief Soe Win met with Karen BGF leader Colonel Saw Chit Thu[357] The Karen BGF announced they would no longer accept salaries from the junta, and would remain ""neutral"" in the conflict. Later, on 6 March, the Karen BGF announced it would rename itself to the ""Karen National Army"".[358]

Kachin conflict escalates [ edit ]

While the KIA is a very close military and political partners with the Three Brotherhood Alliance, being part of the Northern Alliance, it was not affected by the Chinese-brokered ceasefire. Combined forces of the KIA, ABSDF, and Kachin PDF captured the town of Mongmit on 19 January and neighboring Mabein on the 20th. The next day, they captured the strategically significant Man Wein Gyi base near Ruili.[359] However, the junta would recapture Mongmit on 25 January.[360]

The KIA also intensified attacks in Hpakant Township,[360] capturing a camp southwest of Hpakant on 20 January and[361] threatening the Myitkyina-Hpakant road with the capture of Namtein outpost on 2 February.[362] There were also attacks in Mansi Township, including the capture of the Si Kham Gyi base, which had continually been held by the junta for 30 years.[359]

On 7 March the KIA simultaneously launched attacks on over ten junta outposts in eastern Kachin. Fighting primarily took place along the highway between Bhamo and the Kachin State capital, Myitkyina, as well as around Laiza. The attacks were the beginning of a wider offensive in Kachin State- colloquially termed Operation 0307.[363] Over 8 March, the KIA seized three major junta bases and several outposts, including Hpyun Pyen Bum, the junta's closest forward base to KIA headquarters in Laiza.[364] The KIA and AA defending Laiza alleged that junta airstrikes had landed on the Chinese side of the border, east of Laiza.[365] During the fighting, the leader of the junta-aligned Lisu ""Wuyang People's Militia"", U Shwe Min, was killed.[366] By 22 March, the KIA claimed to have captured over 50 military outposts and 13 strategically significant junta bases around the Myitkyina-Bhamo Road.[367]

In April, the KIA had captured the key Chinese border trade hub of Lweje,[368] cut off a major road to Hpakant,[369] and captured Sezin.[370] and Hsinbo. Within Hsinbo, they cut off the Bhamo-Myitkyina road and encircled Bhamo.[371] The KIA then launched simultaneous offensives throughout Waingmaw Township and around Sumprabum, capturing several junta bases, camps and command centers.[372] By 8 May, they had captured 11 battalion headquarters throughout the state[373] and captured Sumprabum Township.[374]

Through the rest of May, the KIA captured Momauk after junta soldiers retreated,[375] attacked a bridge at the entrance of the state capital Myitkyina.[376] and made gains in Mansi[377] and Tanai[378] The KIA took an additional dozen junta bases in Waingmaw Township starting in 20 May, securing their positions.[379]

Continued Rakhine offensive [ edit ]

At the same time, the Rakhine offensive continued through March. On 5 March, the Arakan Army captured Ponnagyun and threatening the regional capital Sittwe, only 33 kilometres away.[380] On 17 March, continued Arakan Army assaults took Rathedaung and its township, cutting off Sittwe from the rest of Rakhine by land.[381]

On 12 March, after an 85-day battle, the Arakan Army captured the town of Ramree. The capture of Ramree brought nearly all of Ramree Island under the Arakan Army's control except for the deep sea port city of Kyaukphyu.[382]

On 24 March, the Arakan Army began an offensive in central Rakhine concurrently with their offensive on Sittwe, launching attacks on Ann, the headquarters of the junta's Western Command. North of Ann, the Arakan Army launched attacks on neighbouring Ngape Township in Magway Region. Ann's location is strategically important as the link between Rakhine and Magway via the Minbu-Ann road through the Arakan Mountains and as a gateway preventing AA from attacking southern Rakhine State.[383] Through April, the Arakan Army captured a portion of the Ann-Minbu Highway, cutting off Ann from neighboring Padein,[384] and captured bases in the hilltops of Ann township.[385]

Northern Rakhine offensives saw little territory change until 3 May when the Arakan Army captured the headquarters of the Border Guard Police in Maungdaw Township at Kyee Kan Pyin,[386] forcing at least 128 junta soldiers to cross the border into Bangladesh.[387] Buthidaung and its surrounding township fell to the Arakha Army on 18 May.[388] After its capture, Rohingya activists accused the Arakan Army of burning and targeting Rohingya homes in the town, a claim which the Arakan Army denied.[389]

On 29 May, junta and allied Arakan Liberation Army soldiers killed over 70 villagers in Byian Phyu near Sittwe due to suspected Arakan Army sympathies in the village.[390]

From late May to early June, the Arakan Army launched attacks on the remainder of Maungdaw Township. On 16 June, the AA urged the residents of Maungdaw to evacuate the town, claiming that all junta bases in the township had either been captured or encircled, and that they would attack the town.[391] In response, the Bangladesh Navy deployed warships to the disputed St. Martin's Island, which had been shot at several times by junta forces.[392] On 4 July, the AA entered Maungdaw, attacking the last junta holdout in the town.[393]

Capture of Papun and Myawaddy [ edit ]

On 20 March, the Karen National Liberation Army and its PDF allies began to besiege the town of Papun, the capital of Hpapun District, Karen State. Eight days later, the town was captured, with fighting moving to the hills outside the town.[53]

After a prolonged siege and several days of negotiations, on 5 April over 600 junta soldiers and their families in Myawaddy surrendered to the KNU and withdrew across the border to Mae Sot,[394] leaving only the 275th Light Infantry Battalion (LIB) near the western entrance to defend the town. By 10 April, KNLA and PDF troops captured the LIB base with the 200 LIB soldiers withdrawing to the 2nd Thai-Myanmar Friendship Bridge on the border. This prompted Thailand to deploy the 3rd Army along the border.[395] The junta sent reinforcements to retake the town, but they were stalled in Kyondoe.[396] On 12 April, Thai officials and the KNU confirmed the capture of Myawaddy.[397] The junta retaliated with airstrikes although locals reported no KNLA presence in the streets.[398]

Despite the KNLA's major role in the battle, they ceded control of the town to the Karen National Army (KNA) to ensure security[399] and reportedly due to the KNA's role in negotiations for the initial surrender.[400]

On 19 April the KNLA attacked the remaining LIB 275th soldiers who were still holding out under the 2nd Thai-Myanmar Friendship Bridge. The junta responded with airstrikes, killing several civilians and forcing the KNLA to delay further attacks.[401][402]

Continued battle for Myawaddy [ edit ]

After Myawaddy's capture the junta launched Operation Aung Zeya, a counteroffensive to retake the town led by Light Infantry Division (LID) 55, numbering around 1,000 and reportedly led by the junta's second-in-command Soe Win. On 16 April, the LID 55 began attempting to cross the Dawna Range[403] but was continually intercepted by the KNLA and allies, being forced to retreat and reportedly experiencing heavy losses.[404]

Early in the counteroffensive KNLA forces withdrew from most of Kawkareik.[405] On 21 April, a junta convoy was routed in Kawkareik Township,[406] but junta forces successfully recaptured Kawkareik the next day despite losing vehicles to the KNLA.[407]

On 23 April, the KNA helped the LIB 275th soldiers sheltering under the 2nd Friendship Bridge to retake their base west of Myawaddy.[408] The following day, KNU spokesman stated that they would ""temporarily withdraw"" from Myawaddy, but vowed to continue guerrilla attacks along the AH1.[409]

The stalled LID 55 advancement moving through the Dawna Range reached the Taw Naw waterfall by 29 April.[410] However, the counteroffensive was stalled again, without any major gains the following month. Residents reported that the KNA had helped ""hundreds"" of junta soldiers to reach Myawaddy through forested paths.[411]

Mon and Karenni resistance [ edit ]

Karenni resistance continued with Operation 1111 aiming to capture Kayah State and its capital Loikaw. On 12 January, joint Karenni forces captured Pekon in neighboring Shan State.[299] On 29 January, the Karenni Nationalities Defence Force (KNDF) captured the town of Mawchi.[412] On 14 February, combined forces of the Karenni Army (KA) and KNDF captured the town of Shadaw after almost a month-long battle, marking the second township to be completely captured in the state.[413] Karenni forces captured Hpasawng and most of Hpasawng Township on 14 March.[414] In a joint statement on 23 March, the KNDF and allies announced that they were in control of nearly 90% of Kayah State, having captured 65 junta positions throughout the state, and six out of nine towns in Kayah[p] (excluding Moebye in Southern Shan State).[52]

On 20 January 2024, local resistance forces in Ye Township, Mon State intensified attacks, announcing their intent to capture Ye.[415] On 14 February, the New Mon State Party (Anti-Military Dictatorship) (MNLA-AMD) split from the Mon National Liberation Army (a signatory of the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement) and effectively declared war on the junta.[416] Around 22 March, Mon State resistance groups began vehicle inspections near Kaleinaung, prompting the junta close roads.[417] On 25 March, the MNLA-AMD and allies, captured the Kawt Bein Police Station in Kawkareik Township, Karen State.[418] In response, junta forces shelled the Kawt Bein area[419] and eventually recaptured the area after a battle on 25 April.[420]

On 8 April, Mon PDF forces launched drone attacks on the Southeastern Command headquarters in Mawlamyine while junta deputy commander-in-chief Soe Win was present. Whether Soe Win was affected remains unknown.[421]

On 29 May, junta forces launched an offensive to resecure Loikaw from Karenni resistance – which had controlled around 80% of the city since November 2023. Junta colums advanced on Loikaw,[422] reaching Kayan Tha Yar village 10 kilometres north of Loikaw the next day[423] and then the Loikaw-Mobye-Hsi Hseng intersection by 3 June before stalling.[331] On 25 June, Karenni resistance captured Maesalawng Hill, near Bawlakhe, after a six day offensive.[424]

Junta counteroffensives in Southern Myanmar [ edit ]

From 8 May to 20 May, junta forces also conducted an offensive throughout Thayetchaung Township, the longest of such offensives in Tanintharyi Region since the 2021 coup. The offensive displaced 5,000 civilians from 8 villages.[425]

In late May, junta forces captured Pedak outpost on the road between Dawei and Myeik.[426] In early June, around 600 junta soldiers were sent to recapture areas of the Ye - Dawei highway from Karen, Mon, and PDF forces who had captured the highway in March, The junta used heavy artillery and the resistance warned civilians to avoid the road, accusing the junta of using human shields and reinforcements disguised as civilians.[427] On 1 July, junta forces launched an offensive on the Zardi Village Tract of Yebyu Township, attempting to recapture areas surrounding the Dawei Special Economic Zone.[428]

Second phase of Operation 1027 and renewed rebel advances (June 2024-August 2024) [ edit ]

Map of anti-junta gains made during Operation 1027 as of September 2024

In June 2024, the Three Brotherhood Alliance's Haigeng ceasefire with the junta broke down seeing junta battalions destroyed and multiple towns in Shan state and beyond fall to the resistance, culminating in the capture of the Northern Shan State capital and headquarders of the Northeast Command, Lashio, in August 2024.[429] Outside Shan State, the Myanmar military faced significant losses in Rakhine State where the Arakan Army gained almost full control by August 2024. In Mandalay, the Brotherhood Alliance and other armed groups escalated attacks, getting close to Mandalay. Despite these setbacks, the military continued efforts to reassert control, including forming new militias and intensifying conscription across the country.[430] Although 1027 began in Shan State, widespread escalation dramatically shifted the balance of power, leading to EAOs in other areas making dominant gains and crippling the military junta with personnel attritions and historic levels of defections.[431]

Operation 1027 (Phase 2) [ edit ]

While it took until June for the Haigeng ceasefire to fully breakdown, tensions began as early as March. The ceasefire was formalised on 1 March at a meeting in Kunming, with the junta reportedly agreeing to recognise the MNDAA's authority over Kokang.[432] But as early as 26 March, junta forces attempted to invade MNDAA territory near Lashio but was repelled militarily.[433] In response, the Chinese ambassador to Myanmar met with the junta foreign minister to discuss ending the clashes.[434]

Tensions began to grow again in Northern Shan State on 9 June after the junta launched airstrikes on TNLA positions in Mongmit Township. TNLA would accuse the junta of violating the ceasefire.[435] Through mid-June, junta forces amassed near 3BA-territories and destroyed roads in the area[436][437]

On 23 June, the junta clashed with Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA) near Lashio.[438] and with the TNLA around Kyaukme, Nawnghkio Township, and Mogok Township on 24 June.[439] On 25 June, the TNLA announced that it had restarted Operation 1027 in Northern Shan State,[440] and encircled Kyaukme.[441]

On 26 June, most of Nawnghkio was captured by PDF and TNLA forces.[442] By 28 June, the TNLA had captured most of the district capital town Kyaukme and continued attacking the junta bases around the town.[55]

Southern Rakhine offensives [ edit ]

Concurrently in early June, the Arakan Army made significant gains in southern Rakhine state. On 2 June, clashes erupted on the Thandwe-Taungup highway and near the resort beach of Ngapali, Thandwe Township,[443] trapping resort goers.[444] Over the next week, the fighting moved closer to Thandwe, forcing the Thandwe Airport to close.[445]

On 15 June, the Arakan Army clashed with junta forces near neighbouring Taungup[446] and on the Taungup-Pandaung road.[447] After months of relative peace in the area, heavy clashes broke out outside of Kyaukphyu on 17 June as junta forces left Danyawaddy naval base.[448]

On 23 June, AA forces captured Thandwe Airport, the first airport to be captured by resistance forces since the 2021 coup.[449] The airport's capture was not confirmed for another week, with AA claiming that 400 junta soldiers had died in the battle.[450] The AA began attacking the beach itself on 26 June.[451] On 17 July, AA forces captured Thandwe itself after three weeks of fighting.[452]

Continued Chin offensive and infighting [ edit ]

Various Chin actors continued the war against the junta in early 2024, with resistance efforts picking up in May. However, in June, the Chin resistance began to engage in conflict with each other as infighting increased in June. Signs of infighting began as early as January when CDFs and CNA clashed with the Maraland Defence Force (MDF), a CBA member.[453] The infighting in Chin State became broadly split along those aligned with the Chin Brotherhood Alliance (CBA) and the Chinland Council, which is dominated by the Chin National Army (CNA). Local Chinland Defense Forces (CDFs) are generally aligned with the CBA, though some like the CDF-Mara are aligned with the CNA.[454]

On 2 May 2024, CBA aligned groups captured the strategic town of Kyindwe, Kanpetlet Township with the aid of the Arakan Army during the conclusion of the four-month long Battle of Kyindwe.[455] The CC would then attempt to take Tonzang from the junta and its ally the Zomi Revolutionary Army[456] capturing the town and neighbouring Cikha by 21 May.[457]

The following week, the CBA moved on neighbouring Tedim,[458] By mid-June, the Junta pushing back from Tedim, recaptured positions along the Tedim-Kalay road and took back Kennedy Peak.[459] Junta forces pushed as far as to recapture the strategic Tainngen village[460] before losing both Kennedy Peak and Taingen to Chinland Council-led counteroffensives and retreating to Khaing Kham by 27 June.[461] On 27 July, the CNA and ZRA met in Aizawl for peace negotiations.[462]

On 30 May, CDF-Matupi captured the district administrative office on the Matupi-Hakha road in Matupi Township.[54] On 24 June, CDFs clashed with junta forces outside of the Chin State capital Hakha. The junta retaliated by setting fires to homes in the town.[463] On 20 July, as part of ""Operation Rung"", the CDF-Hakha captured the Hakha Main Police Station, releasing 62 detainees.[464]

Operation Chin Brotherhood [ edit ]

Matupi town, captured by Operation Chin Brotherhood on 29 June 2024

On 9 June, the CBA, Arakan Army and Magway-based Yaw Army began ""Operation Chin Brotherhood"" attacking Matupi.[465] Shortly after the announcement, the Chinland Council issued a statement asking the Arakan Army to refrain from military and administrative operations in Chinland.[466] This came days after Global Khumi Organisation urged the Arakha Army against committing human rights violations against the Khumi Chin people of Paletwa Township.[467]

Operation Chin Brotherhood continued with CBA aligned forces capturing one of the two junta battalion bases outside Matupi on 17 June.[468] Clashes between the CBA and CBA broke out during the push towards the final base, leading to 2 CBA deaths.[469] The CNA/Chinland Council was forced to retreat from the Matupi area by 24 June[470] On 29 June, the CBA captured the remaining junta base near Matupi and took over the town.[471]

Infighting continued with CNA detaining other Yaw Defense Force soldiers[472] and MDF and AA taking Lailenpi, Matupi Township from the CDF-Mara and CNA.[473]

Kachin theater [ edit ]

On 4 June renewed clashes broke out outside of Momeik.[474] A week later, KIA forces captured the Waingmaw-Sadung-Kanpaikti road, cutting off the state capital Myitkyina from the border.[475]

On 15 July, junta forces launched an offensive to recapture areas near Momauk.[476] A month later, on 19 August, KIA forces captured the last junta base in Momauk, completing their capture of the township.[477] Shortly after, junta forces launched another counteroffensive to retake the town, but were stalled at Aung Myay village.[478]

Karenni fighting [ edit ]

On 1 July, junta forces began attacking KNDF positions south of Pinlaung, attempting to relieve the Karenni siege on Pekon.[479]

In early July, fighting further intensified in Loikaw as Karenni resistance attempted to recapture areas of the town they had earlier been forced to withdraw from.[480] The Irrawaddy reported on 8 July that fighting is intensifying after reinforcements of 500 troops had arrived to help the already stationed 1,500 Tatmadaw troops.[481]

By mid July in Hpasawng Township, there has been reports of fresh intense fighting, incl. Karenni claims of poisoned gas use by Tatmadaw against the resistance fighters.[482] Meanwhile, in Loikaw, pro-Tatmadaw sources confirm fighting in Loikaw, Pekhon and Mobye. In addition it claims Tatmadaw progress in the direction of Loikaw University.[483]

Battle of Lashio [ edit ]

Smoke rising from Lashio after the bombing, July 2024

On 2 July, the MNDAA began the Battle of Lashio against the heavily defended capital and largest town of northern Shan State. The TNLA joined the offensive the next day with the 2 armies attacking 4 junta bases surrounding Lashio. Pro-junta Telegram channels accused the Shan State Progress Party (SSPP) of joining the offensive.[484] On 5 July, TNLA forces entered Lashio proper from the south.[485] The next day, the MNDAA captured Nampawng village south of Lashio, encircling the town, and began launching attacks into Lashio.[486]

Concurrently MNDAA forces clashed with junta forces in Mongyai Township[487] and TNLA began launching attacks into Momeik.[488]

Tensions and disputes rose between TNLA and the Shan State Army (SSPP), with both sides asking the United Wa State Army (UWSA) for mediation.[489] On 10 July, the TNLA attacked junta positions near Tangyan.[490] Following an agreement with the Tatmadaw, the neutral UWSA deployed thousands of soldiers around Tangyan to prevent clashes from spreading to the area.[491] On 13 July, SSPP forces occupied Mongyai, with residents claiming that clashes might break out in the town due to the apparent SSPP-junta agreement.[492]

On 25 July, in a ""historic victory"", the MNDAA claimed to have captured the Northeastern Command headquarters of Lashio, the first regional command headquarters to ever be captured by resistance forces.[493] On 30 July, MNDAA forces ambushed junta reinforcements attempting to reach Lashio, inflicting heavy casualties.[494] On 3 August, the capture of Lashio and the Northeastern Command headquarters was confirmed, with hundreds of Burmese soldiers surrendering.[57] The Northeastern Command had exiled their leadership to Muse, which remained the last junta stronghold in the area due to its proximity with the Chinese border.[495]

Ceasefire attempts and ""Shan-Man"" [ edit ]

On 14 July, the MNDAA instituted a tenuous 4-day ceasefire after meeting with the Chinese Communist Party. Despite the ceasefire, clashes continued.[496][497] TNLA and SSPP leaders also met in Panghsang, Wa State, to discuss an end to clashes.[498] On 16 July, TNLA captured most of Mongmit and began launching attacks on the junta headquarters south of the town.[56]

At the same time as the renewed 1027 offensive, the NUG announced that it had joined in the offensive through its People's Defense Forces in Mandalay Region, calling the attacks a ""Shan Man"" operation.[499] As part of Operation Shan-Man, the Mandalay People's Defence Force (MDY-PDF) captured 36 junta positions in late June and early July throughout northern Mandalay Region.[500] The MDY-PDF and TNLA also captured Nawnghkio on 10 July[501] and Singu Township by 12 July, further cutting off junta forces in Northern Shan State.[502]

Mogok, Mandalay Region

On 20 July, the 3BA, reportedly under pressure from China, agreed to extend the ceasefire to 31 July.[503] Despite the agreements, junta reinforcements launched renewed attacks on Kyaukme on the same day.[504] On 24 July, TNLA and PDF forces completely captured Mogok, Mandalay Region.[505]

The TNLA captured the Shan state towns of Momeik on 31 July[506] and Kyaukme on 6 August.[507] On 10 August, TNLA forces launched an offensive against Hsipaw, capturing the town's prison[508] and then nearby Nawngkawgyi village by 13 August.[509]

On 12 August, MDY-PDF captured Tagaung, the first historical capital of the Burmese monarchy, after a one-day battle.[510] The following week, Mandalay-PDF captured Thabeikkyin, capturing the town and its surroundings. The entirety of Thabeikkyin District came under rebel control.[511]

Stalemates, Chinese pressure, and western front escalations (August 2024 – March 2025) [ edit ]

After the fall of Lashio, the junta launched counter offensives, but facing an inability to make progress, changed its tactics to favour aerial bombardment to destroy towns they could not take, like Lashio.[512] The rebels, too, have failed to make as much progress due to diplomatic pressures and supply issues. Analyst Yun Sun from the Stimson Center noted Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi's visit in mid-August as indicative of a shift in China's stance from greenlighting Operation 1027 in November 2023 to endorsing the State Administration Council and criticising the Northern Alliance and the United Wa State Army (UWSA) for not standing down.[513] There are signs that China is accelerating weapons transfers to the junta and restricting key ammunition supplies to the TNLA, affecting the resistance's realistic prospects of taking Mandalay despite the junta being in its weakest position since 2021.[514] However, this recent alignment with the military regime has strained its influence over border groups like the 3BA, diminishing China's sway and ability to mediate in this new landscape.[515] China's support temporarily slowed the rebels' momentum but failed to reverse the trend of humiliating losses, including the fall of a second Regional Military Command in Ann, Rakhine State. Instead, China finds its interests threatened as the Arakan Army surround Kyaukphyu and Kachin groups seize control of rare earth mineral mines.[431] Chinese-backed peace talks and pressure for MNDAA to retreat from Lashio continued in early 2025 but failed in late March 2025.[516]

In January 2025, The New York Times reported that the rebels were opening colleges and universities in the territory they controlled.[517]

Operation Hsinphyushin [ edit ]

Street in Nawnghkio

In late August, the Tatmadaw began preparing an offensive to recapture key towns in northern Shan State, terming it as “Operation Hsin Phyu Shin” (after the Burmese king Hsinbyushin).[518] Throughout September and October, the Tatmadaw began massing forces in the final towns it controlled in Northern Shan State (Namlan, Mongyai, and Tangyan) in preparation for the counteroffensive to retake Lashio.[519]

This came in the context of strained China-3BA relations. On 29 August, the Ruili City Security Commission issued a statement demanding the TNLA to end all offensive operations against the junta, threatening ""more deterrent and disciplinary measures"" if it did not.[520] 4 days later, the junta designated the Three Brotherhood Alliance and its members as ""terrorist groups"".[521] On 19 September, the MNDAA announced that it would end its offensive operations, further stating it would refuse to ever work with the National Unity Government of Myanmar.[522] Despite the Chinese threat, the TNLA captured the last junta base in Hsipaw on 13 October.[523]

On 19 October, Tatmadaw forces launched a counteroffensive, aimed at retaking Nawnghkio instead of Lashio.[524]

On 18 November, it was confirmed that MNDAA leader Peng Daxun had been detained in Yunnan by Chinese authorities since late October, further pressuring MNDAA forces to relinquish Lashio to the junta.[525]

In early December, the MNDAA declared a unilateral ceasefire and expressed willingness to engage in peace talks with the junta, with China acting as a mediator.[526] The MNDAA announced its readiness to send a high-level delegation for dialogue to resolve conflicts through political means.[527] However, despite this announcement, airstrikes on TNLA-held areas continued.[528] On 20 January 2025, the MNDAA and the junta agreed to a Chinese-brokered ceasefire, with several sources claiming that a withdraw of the former from Lashio was a condition for the deal. However, at the time neither the junta nor the MNDAA revealed any details of the deal.[529] The pressure for MNDAA to retreat from Lashio continued but ceasefire talks failed in late March 2025.[516]

Renewed southern Shan assault [ edit ]

In early August, the PNLA launched a renewed assault on the outskirts of Hsi Hseng after junta forces in the town bombed the PNLA headquarters in Mawkmai Township.[530] At the same time, the junta-allied PNO intensified military preparations by training 10,000 militia members in Pinlaung Township, in southern Shan State, aimed at bolstering the defense of Naypyitaw.[531] On 10 September, the PNLO split after disputes surrounding a ceasefire with the junta, with pro-ceasefire leaders breaking off to form the ""PNLO-NCA-S.""[532]

On 19 September, the Tatmadaw and allied Lahu military attacked a Shan State Army (RCSS) base in Yanghkam, Mong Ping Township.[533]

Continued attacks in the Dry Zone [ edit ]

PDF forces in Magway Region, August 2024

The People's Defence Forces also continued fighting outside of the Shan-Man context. On 11 June the Union Liberation Front and Sagaing Region People's Defence Organisation captured a junta base near the Sagaing capital Monywa.[534] On 27 June, a coalition of several PDFs attacked Budalin.[535]

On 17 July, People's Defense Forces launched 2 rockets at Nay Pyi Taw International Airport, causing no casualties.[536]

On 10 August, PDFs in Myingyan District, central Mandalay Region, launched an offensive against Taungtha and Natogyi.[537] Natogyi was briefly captured before being recaptured by the junta soon after. On 15 August, PDF launched an offensive on Tabayin, Sagaing Region, again capturing the town by 18 August briefly before withdrawing shortly after due to junta counter attacks.[538] In mid-August, the KIA and PDF launched joint offensives on Indaw, Pinlebu, and Htigyaing, Sagain Region.[539] Resistance forces captured Pinlebu on 8 October, defeating almost 800 junta soldiers.[540]

On 11 November, the Burma National Revolutionary Army and several other PDF's launched attacks on Pale before being forced to retreat due to junta counter attacks.[541]

Late 2024 Kachin offensives [ edit ]

On 7 September, KIA forces began attacking Singtawn -outside Hpakant- after junta forces raided a hotel in the area, capturing the village one month later.[542] In late September, it was reported that junta forces were preparing an offensive to retake Sumprabum and Tiyangzug.[543]

On 29 September, the KIA launched an offensive on Chipwi and Hsawlaw, capturing both towns by 2 October. Shortly after, the KIA asked the Kachin Border Guard Forces to defect, but were denied.[544] In response, the KIA launched an offensive on Kachin BGF battalions 1002 and 1003, capturing both by 22 October.[545][546]

Pang War, Myanmar on a snowy day

The KIA then captured the Kachin BGF's headquarters in the town of Pang War on 20 October with Kachin BGF leader Zahkung Ting Ying fled to China.[547] On 1 November, the KIA launched an attack on the final BGF 1001 bases at Nuzaungbaung and Phimaw, capturing both by the next day. Border Guard Forces fled to Kangfang (Ganfai), which the KIA captured days later.[548] On 10 November, KIA forces completed the capture of Kachin Special Region 1 and all of the Kachin BGF territory when they took Lanse village.[549] On 20 November, despite Chinese pressure not to, the KIA captured Kanpaikti, the final Kachin BGF base.[550]

In December, the KIA and allies attacked Myanmar junta targets in Bhamo and Mansi townships.[551]

Chin theatre [ edit ]

In early August, the Chin National Army and allies took in Thantlang after about a week of fighting.[552]

On 9 November, the Chin Brotherhood Alliance relaunched Operation Chin Brotherhood, launching simultaneous offensives on Falam and Mindat, capturing most of the former.[553]

In December 2024, the Chin Brotherhood Alliance (CBA) achieved significant victories in Chin State. On 15 December, 123 junta troops and police officers from Mindat district and township police compounds, together with their families, surrendered to the CBA.[554] On 21 December, the CBA declared Mindat a junta-free zone following the rescue of 13 political prisoners.[555] These victories further consolidated the CBA's control in the region and demonstrated the strength of Operation Chin Brotherhood.

Advances in Rakhine and the fall of Ann [ edit ]

On 20 December 2024, the Arakan Army (AA) claimed to have captured the Myanmar military's Western Command headquarters in Ann, Rakhine State.

After the capture of Thandwe, Arakan Army forces launched an offensive south towards Gwa, capturing Kyeintali by 14 August.[556] On 5 September, the AA captured Maung Shwe Lay Naval Base, the first naval base to be captured by resistance forces.[557] On 25 September, the AA launched an offensive on the remaining bases in Ann. By 25 October, the AA captured the remaining Mae Taung bases, encircled Ann, and captured the town's airport.[558] On 7 November, the AA launched an offensive on neighboring Taungup.[559] The Arakan Army captured Maungdaw in the first half of December, after securing the Junta's last remaining position there. The AA captured General Thurein Tun during the operation.[560][561]

In December 2024, the AA achieved significant victories in Rakhine State. On December 8, the AA captured Maungdaw Township, securing full control over the 271-kilometer border with Bangladesh.[562] This strategic gain was followed by the seizure of the Western Regional Command headquarters in Ann Township on December 20, marking the second regional command center to fall to ethnic armed groups within five months.[563] On December 29, the AA extended its campaign by seizing full control of Gwa Township, the southernmost town in Rakhine State, after junta troops retreated from the area.[564] This victory further consolidated the AA's dominance in the region, leaving only a few townships under junta control.[565] The AA's leadership has since expressed readiness to engage in political dialogue to seek resolution to the ongoing conflict.[566]

In January 2025, Arakan Army and joint PDF forces pushed into Shwethaungyan Subtownship, northwest Ayeyarwaddy Region taking the village of Magyizin.[567] Battle with the junta intensified in the area as the Myanmar Navy increased bombardments to the Bawmi coastline area near Magyizin by 20 January 2025.[568] By late March, AA had reached the eastern side of the Arakan mountains taking villages in Lemyethna Township near the Pathein-Monywa Highway.[569]

Karen State clashes and key KNLA advances [ edit ]

After the Karen National Army set a five-month deadline in May 2024 for Chinese scamming operatives to leave Myawaddy, many have migrated to the Three Pagodas Pass, controlled by the Democratic Karen Benevolent Army.[570] Throughout May, the KNLA, aided by allies, captured all but three of the remaining junta bases in Hpapun Township.[571]

On 1 June, clashes erupted between KNLA-led forces and joint Karen National Army/junta forces near Tonetatdar. A source close to the junta claimed that Karen National Army (KNA) soldiers were coordinating to join with junta soldiers from Operation Aung Zeya to retake Myawaddy, Thingannyinaung and to attack the Asian Highway 1 (AH1).[572] However, after being stalled for months by ambushes on the AH1, the Aung Zeya column was forced to retreat to Kawkareik.[573]

On 9 August, KNLA forces clashed with junta reinforcements near Zayatkyi, Htantabin Township.[574]

In December 2024, the KNLA achieved significant victories in Kayin State. On December 17, the KNLA attacked the Swe Taw Kone junta camp near Lay Kay Kaw village, capturing prisoners and seizing weapons.[575] Additionally, the KNLA recaptured its former headquarters, Manerplaw, on the Thai border, further consolidating its control in the region.[576]

Shifting Karenni frontlines [ edit ]

In early August, the Tatmadaw and civilian sources reported that the Tatmadaw had secured Loikaw and much of the surrounding township.[577] On 5 September, the KNDF attempted to assassinate Tatmadaw leader Min Aung Hlaing while he was visiting Loikaw.[578]

As of September 20, 2024, the Myanmar junta only had control of Loikaw and Bawlakhe Townships.[579]

During October, fighting shifted to North Kayah State, after the flooding of Typhoon Yagi. Tatmadaw troops and Pa-O militia attacked several Karenni Resistance-held settlements including Pinlaung, Mobye and Pekon.[580] Pekon was taken in a military counter-offensive taking advantage of the flooding caused by Yagi.[581] However, Karenni leadership believes that the Tatmadaw does not aim to hold the territory, only to shore up its supply lines[582] as the Tatmadaw has to use helicopters to maintain some supply lines.[583] While fighting was reported early December along Pekon-Moebye-Loikaw road.[584]

On 29 October, it was announced that several Karenni resistance groups united to form the Kayan National Army.[585]

In January 2025, El País reported that Demoso has become a major center for refugees, housing some 150,000 displaced civilians.[586]

Fighting over Mobye [ edit ]

Tatmadaw has succeeded in taking Mobye, the town, during its offensive in December. Now as of early February the KNDF launches an advance to retake the town.[14]

Early March, reports of air and artillery strikes in Pekhon and Loikaw.[587] ""Heavy Clashes"" repoted in Mobye.[588] While KNDF had announced it launched an offensive to retake Mobye from Tatmadaw, who had taken it in December.[14] Junta is reported to have taken high casualties when taking the town. With KNDF now defending against a Junta bid to ""Reclaim"" Mobye from KNDF. The Junta is now sending reinforcements from Loikaw to help in this effort. Additional areas are mentioned, with the Irrawaddy citing an KNDF member saying: ""Fighting has also broken out in [Karenni’s] Loikaw, Hpasaung, and Bawlakhae townships over the past month, but Mobye has seen the heaviest clashes. The junta has suffered significant casualties while we have also lost some comrades"". Mobye is strategically located 40 km from Loikaw.[589]

Myanmar civil war: a quick guide to the conflict,2025-01-31T00:00:00,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/jan/31/why-is-myanmar-embroiled-in-conflict,"Myanmar is a south-east Asian country that has experienced decades of conflict and repressive military rule since it gained independence from Britain in 1948. Since a military coup in 2021, fighting has flared once again. Here’s a primer on the conflict:

What’s the history behind the current fighting? Myanmar spent decades under military rule from 1962 to 2011, and was a pariah state subject to severe international sanctions. However, the country gradually began to liberalise and transition to a democracy. A nominally civilian government was introduced in 2011, and historic elections took place in 2015. National League for Democracy (NLD), the party of opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who had spent years in prison during military rule, won the vote by a landslide. The military still retained significant political power, however, and in 2021 Myanmar’s transition towards democracy was cut short when it seized power in a coup.

What happened after the coup? The coup was widely opposed by the public who took to the streets nationwide in mass protests. The military responded with deadly force, and began arresting anyone suspected of criticising its rule. In response, many civilians joined so-called people’s defence forces, to fight against it. Some ethnic armed groups, which have long fought for independence, also began fighting the military. These group’s specific goals, and the extent to which they are coordinated, varies. Fighting has spiralled across much of the country, including parts of the centre, which had rarely seen conflict in previous decades.

Who is winning and is there any likelihood of peace soon? The sheer number of groups fighting against the military has left the generals severely overstretched. It has endured the most humiliating defeats in its history, losing huge swathes of territory including along the borders with China and Bangladesh. Dozens of towns and military battalions and even two regional commands have been lost. A study by the BBC estimates the military controls just 21% of territory. The military has been accused of repeatedly bombing civilian sites, including schools and hospitals, torching villages, carrying out mass killings, and torturing its opponents in a desperate attempt to cling to power. Calls for the resignation of the junta chief Min Aung Hlaing have grown among pro-military circles, however he shows no signs of backing down. The military has promised elections this year, but it is unclear how it will implement these given that large areas of the country are controlled by its opponents.

What are the US, EU and other countries saying or doing about it? The US and EU have imposed a series of sanctions on figures and businesses linked to Myanmar’s military, however these have had little impact. The regional bloc, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, has led international efforts to resolve the crisis, but with no success. It agreed upon a five-point concensus in 2021, which included a commitment to immediately end violence, and for constructive dialogue to find a peaceful solution. However, conflict has only escalated in the years since.

Which country has most influence over Myanmar? China. It is an ally of, and supplies weapons to, the military but it also has ties with some of the powerful ethnic armed groups located near its shared border. China’s response to the coup has shifted over time. Its initial response to the coup in 2021 was muted, but Beijing grew increasingly frustrated with the military’s inability to control the country, and especially its failure to clamp down on the criminal scam centres that proliferated in border areas and which targeted Chinese citizens. In 2023 it gave implicit approval for the Brotherhood Alliance, formed of armed ethnic organisations in the north, to launch an offensive against the military, in what many analysts believe was an attempt to punish the junta. However, when these groups launched a second offensive in 2024, and succeeding in taking even more territory, China put pressure on them to stop by cutting off border supplies, apparently concerned that the military could lose control of central cities. Since then, it has been more supportive of the military. China will look to protect its interests in Myanmar, said Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Stimson Center: “Border stability, investment, connectivity projects, and keeping Americans out.”

Who are the Rohingya and why are they so badly affected by this conflict? The Rohingya are a Muslim ethnic minority group who have lived for centuries in Myanmar. Despite this, they are not recognised as an official ethnic group and have been denied citizenship since 1982, making them the world’s largest stateless population, according to the UN. The Rohingya crisis escalated dramatically in August 2017 when, in response to small attacks by a Rohingya armed group, the military conducted deadly “clearance operations” that drove more than 700,000 Rohingya across the border to seek safety in Bangladesh. The events led to allegations of genocide in the UN’s top court. For the estimated 600,000 Rohingya remaining in Myanmar the situation is especially dire. They are now caught between the military and its opponent in Rakhine state, the Arakan Army (AA), which has taken control of much of the state. Rohingya say they have been subject to forced recruitment by the junta, as well as deadly attacks by the AA, which has accused them of siding with the military.

What happened to Aung San Suu Kyi? View image in fullscreen Aung San Suu Kyi delivers a speech in Naypyitaw, Myanmar, in January 2020. Photograph: Aung Shine Oo/AP Aung San Suu Kyi is Myanmar’s most famous politician. Born in Myanmar, which was then Burma under British rule, in 1945, she was the daughter of Myanmar’s independence hero, Gen Aung San. She went to the University of Oxford, then worked at the UN for three years, before marrying British historian Michael Aris in 1972. After moving back to Myanmar in 1988, Aung San Suu Kyi became swept up in pro-democracy demonstrations opposing the ruling junta. In 1988 she co-founded the NLD, and was placed under house arrest the following year, where she remained on-and-off for 15 years. Globally, she was hailed as an icon for peace and democracy, and was awarded the Nobel peace prize in 1991. When Myanmar eventually held elections in 2015, the NLD won a sweeping victory. Aung San Suu Kyi was prevented from becoming president by a clause in the constitution, but became state counsellor. Internationally her reputation suffered hugely when she failed to condemn the military’s brutal violence against the Rohingya minority. She remained highly popular domestically, however. She was detained again in February 2021, after the military coup",Rebecca Ratcliffe,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e8a6b748fef55b6a54f6446b8b9b9e900c5b592/0_282_6118_3671/master/6118.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7925c20b3e0ad891c177b72236743d51
Civil War in Myanmar,Published date not found (newspaper3k),https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/rohingya-crisis-myanmar,"Four years after the junta’s 2021 coup, Myanmar’s military government controls only 21 percent of the country’s territory, while rebel forces and ethnic armies hold 42 percent, according to a 2024 investigation by the BBC. The People’s Defense Force (PDF) and its allies continue gaining key territory, pushing the military on the defensive in the Bamar heartland and advancing towards Mandalay. The military junta especially struggles to fight ethnic armed organizations across the country, which have made most of the territorial gains so far. The United Nations has reported that the conflict has displaced over three million civilians and resulted in more than seventy-five thousand total deaths.

Background

Since gaining independence from British rule in 1948, Myanmar (formerly known as Burma) has struggled to govern its multiethnic society effectively. Following a coup in 1962, Myanmar’s military junta has primarily held control of the country, engaging in conflicts with ethnic minority groups fighting for greater autonomy.

These ongoing tensions have their roots in the country’s complex ethnic makeup and the legacy of British colonial rule, which exacerbated divisions among different communities. The conflicts have resulted in widespread human rights abuses, displacement of civilians, and persistent instability across many regions of Myanmar.

In 1990, Myanmar held its first general election since the 1962 military coup. The National League for Democracy (NLD), led by Aung San Suu Kyi, won by a landslide. Suu Kyi, the daughter of the nationalist leader who fought for Burma’s independence and Myanmar’s most prominent democratic activist, was placed under house arrest by the junta before the vote. After the election, the junta refused to recognize the results.

The NLD’s success in the 1990 election made the junta realize its limited support among the populace. To maintain its grip on power, the junta embarked on a decades-long process to enshrine military rule through what it called “disciplined democracy” or a “roadmap to democracy,” which included drafting a new constitution in 2008. The constitution reserved significant power for the military, including control over important ministries and 25 percent of parliamentary seats, effectively granting it veto power over amendments. This approach allowed for limited reforms but ensured the military’s continued influence.

Under the junta’s roadmap, the government held general elections in November 2010. In the leadup to the vote, the junta passed new election laws that prohibited anyone serving a prison sentence or married to a foreign national from running for president—a clear attempt to block Suu Kyi from the ballot, who was still under house arrest and married to a British citizen. The NLD decided to boycott the elections, and the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) won.

In 2015, the NLD returned to participate in general elections, with Suu Kyi unofficially leading the party. The NLD won Myanmar’s first competitive national election in over twenty-five years. Due to the revised election laws, Suu Kyi could not officially become president but became de facto leader as State Counsellor. The NLD entered a power-sharing arrangement with the military according to the 2008 constitution, leading a civilian parliament while the military continued to control crucial executive ministries and oversee security policy.

Despite her reputation as a democratic icon, Suu Kyi lost international support as her NLD government defended the military’s ethnic cleansing against Myanmar’s Rohingya people, a Muslim ethnic minority group of one million. The Rohingya live in western Myanmar’s Rakhine state, which borders present-day Bangladesh. The Rohingya have long faced persecution from the ethnic Bamar majority, who often call them “Bengali” to discredit their right to live in Myanmar. Myanmar’s government asserts that the Rohingya did not settle in historic Burma before British rule began in 1823. This criterion determined which groups are considered “indigenous ethnic” within the 1982 Citizenship Law. Thus, Rohingya are not considered citizens by Myanmar’s government, making them the largest stateless population in the world.

Tensions between Buddhist and Muslim communities in Myanmar’s Rakhine State escalated dramatically after a series of Rohingya militant attacks in October 2016 and August 2017. These attacks on military and police outposts, led by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, killed twelve Burmese security forces personnel in total. In both years, the military responded with brutal crackdowns on Rohingya villages, causing at least 6,700 deaths between August and September 2017 and forcing over 700,000 people to flee across the border to Bangladesh. Widespread reports indicate indiscriminate killings and burning of Rohingya villages, with the UN Human Rights Commissioner calling the situation in Rakhine State “a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.” Since 2017, living conditions for the more than one million Rohingya across the border in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh, have continued to deteriorate.

In November 2020, the NLD won the general election again by a large margin. The military contested the results as fraudulent, sensing the continued democratic success of the NLD posed a long-term threat to its rule. In early February 2021, Myanmar’s military carried out a coup, detaining senior leadership of the democratically-elected government, including de facto head of state Suu Kyi, and forcing other members of parliament into hiding. After seizing power, General Min Aung Hlaing, the leader of the military junta, instituted a year-long state of emergency.

Protests immediately broke out in the capital, Naypyidaw, demanding the restoration of civilian rule and democratic governance. In response, security forces employed lethal force, killing more than six hundred people. The military junta also instituted curfews and other limitations on gatherings to curb the demonstrations. Doubling down, the military launched violent campaigns across the country, targeting resistance villages, silencing and torturing dissenters, and displacing thousands in the process.

As international condemnation amplified, an opposition force of ousted officials, oppressed ethnic groups, and pro-democracy protestors united to form the National Unity Government (NUG) in April 2021. The NUG publicly states its goal of governing Myanmar as a “federal democratic union.” Shortly after, the new coalition formed the People’s Defense Force (PDF)—an armed wing to fight the junta and its allied forces.

As the junta repressed protests, popular support for the democratic resistance movement grew: in 2022, the PDF claimed 65,000 fighters, which had risen to 85,000 soldiers by 2024. Rebel ethnic groups across the country’s states have played a critical role in strengthening the PDF’s efforts, with a common goal of pushing military forces back from local villages. Several of the twenty-five active ethnic armies coordinate with the pro-democracy forces, including the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), Shan State Army, and Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA).

In late October 2023, a coalition of three ethnic armed groups in Shan State launched a coordinated offensive—named Operation 1027, for the date the offensive was launched—against the junta. Known as the Three Brotherhood Alliance, this coalition consists of the Arakan Army (AA), the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), and the Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA). Initially formed in 2019, the group’s 2023 coordinated offensive posed the strongest challenge to military rule since the February 2021 coup. Insurgents used drones to bomb military and police outposts in eastern Kayah State, bordering Thailand; western Rakhine State, bordering India; and northern Shan State, bordering China. By the end of 2023, the offensive captured over 180 military outposts in Shan state.

The military continues to leverage its technological advantages, many of which are granted by foreign suppliers like Russia and China, to fight armed opposition groups. However, waning morale has hindered military cohesion. Its forces have dwindled from the start of the civil war, with only approximately 130,000 soldiers remaining from a collective of 300,000 in 2021.

Recent Developments

While the military still possesses technological superiority, its forces have not been effective in countering rebel offensives. It has lost critical infrastructure and townships, and the country is experiencing significant economic pressures and high rates of food insecurity. The military resorted to forced conscription in February 2024 to address its manpower shortage. Since then, the military has conscripted about thirty thousand people, prompting an exodus of young people fleeing Myanmar’s cities.

In August 2024, the Three Brotherhood Alliance seized the Northeastern Regional Military Command (RMC) in Lashio—a key military headquarters and economic access point to China. Lashio remains under MNDAA control, though fears persist in the city over the MNDAA’s imposition of martial law and rumors of forced conscription.

In December 2024, fighting in the city of Maungdaw in Rakhine State ended with victory for the Arakan Army, an ethnic Buddhist militant group. With the Arakan Army taking control of villages and townships in the state, local minority groups, such as the Rohingya, fear continued ethnic persecution.

Throughout the conflict, both domestic and international support for the NUG has risen. A 2024 survey revealed that around 93 percent of respondents in Myanmar have a favorable opinion of the NUG. The United States, the European Union, and Australia all recognize the NUG as Myanmar’s legitimate government. In January 2025, the junta announced plans for general elections by the end of the year or early 2026 to consolidate political control. Observers fear elections could lead to more violence. The junta also extended its state of emergency by six months.

China has steadily increased its involvement in the conflict, seeking an end to the fighting to preserve the military junta and ensure stability. Beijing has brokered several ceasefires, with mixed results and temporary truces. China’s economic interests in Myanmar include critical minerals, oil and gas, and BRI infrastructure projects. Myanmar also provides deep-sea port access and a key alternative to the Strait of Malacca trade route. Though China continues to provide military support to the junta, it also maintains relations with the NLD.",Center For Preventive Action,https://microsites-live-backend.cfr.org/cdn/ff/ual0KilDvJnDUv-lsLHVqTX7Zt-0bf_qIDakB0YcR-8/1615823503/public/2019-07/RTXZ40V_Myanmar.jpg

Myanmar has been embroiled in armed conflict since 1948, when the country, then known as Burma, gained independence from the United Kingdom.[5][6] The conflict has largely been ethnic-based, with ethnic armed organisations fighting Myanmar's armed forces, the Tatmadaw, for self-determination. Despite numerous ceasefires and the creation of autonomous self-administered zones in 2008, armed groups continue to call for independence, increased autonomy, or the federalisation of Myanmar. It is the world's longest ongoing civil war, spanning almost eight decades.[7][8][9]

In 1940, during World War II, Burmese intellectuals formed the Thirty Comrades, who established the Burma Independence Army (BIA) to fight against the Allies. Aung San led the Axis-puppet State of Burma, before switching allegiance to the Allies in mid-1944. Post-war negotiations led to Burma's independence in 1948, but ethnic tensions arose after the Burmese government refused to honour the 1947 Panglong Agreement, which promised autonomy for some of the country's ethnic minorities. The immediate post-independence period saw the rise of the Communist Party of Burma (CPB) and Karen National Union (KNU) in particular as major rebel forces.

In 1962, Burmese general Ne Win led a military coup, establishing a junta and refusing to adopt a federal system of governance, which led to intensified insurgencies. Ne Win's regime faced internal dissent and growing civil conflict throughout his rule, culminating in the 8888 Uprising in 1988, which was violently suppressed by the military. Following the uprising, the military established the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), later renamed the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC).

Civilian rule was restored in 2011, albeit not fully, with the military retaining power in the country's legislatures through a new constitution. A military coup in 2021 by commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing deposed the civilian government, sparking widespread protests and escalating insurgencies.

Prelude [ edit ]

In 1940, during World War II, a group of young Burmese intellectuals left for Japan to receive military training in preparation for an anti-colonial struggle against the British. This group came to be known as the Thirty Comrades, and upon returning to Burma in 1941 they established the Burma Independence Army (BIA) to fight against the Allies. Upon their capture of Rangoon in 1942, the Japanese established a puppet state, the State of Burma, and reorganised the BIA as its armed forces, the Burma National Army (BNA). Aung San, the leader of the State of Burma and one of the Thirty Comrades, became increasingly sceptical of Japan's ability to win the war as time progressed, and in mid-1944 he decided to switch sides. Japanese forces capitulated by July 1945, and the British began to negotiate Burma's independence with Aung San and other prominent Burmese leaders.

In the lead up to Burmese independence, Aung San negotiated with Chin, Kachin, and Shan leaders, and the Panglong Agreement was reached between them. The agreement promised full autonomy for the areas inhabited by the three ethnic minorities, with an option to secede from Burma ten years after independence. However, Aung San was assassinated shortly afterwards, and the Panglong Agreement was not honoured by the post-independence government under U Nu. This further strained relations between the Bamar ethnic majority and the country's many ethnic minorities.[17]

Course of the conflict [ edit ]

Post-independence insurgencies (1948–1962) [ edit ]

Map of insurgent activity in Burma in 1948 (top) and 1953 (bottom)

Following Burma's independence from the United Kingdom on 4 January 1948, the two largest opposition groups in the country were the communists, led by the Communist Party of Burma (CPB), and the Karen nationalists, led by the Karen National Union (KNU).

Initially there was calm during the transitional period after independence, but on 2 April 1948, the CPB fired the first shots of the conflict in Paukkongyi, Pegu Region (present-day Bago Region). At its peak, the CPB had 15,000 fighters in 1949.

During the post-independence period, the KNU favoured an independent state, governed by the Karen people. The proposed state would have encompassed the territories of Karen State and Karenni State (present-day Kayin State and Kayah State), in Lower Burma (Outer Myanmar). The KNU has since shifted their focus from full independence to regional autonomy, under a federal system with fair Karen representation in the government.[21]

Ne Win's dictatorship (1962–1988) [ edit ]

After three successive parliamentary governments governed Myanmar, the Tatmadaw, led by General Ne Win, enacted a coup d'état on 2 March 1962, which ousted the parliamentary government and replaced it with a military junta. Accusations of severe human rights abuses and violations followed afterwards, and the cabinet of the parliamentary government and political leaders of ethnic minority groups were arrested and detained without trial.[22] Around this period, other ethnic minority groups began forming larger rebel factions, such as the Kachin Independence Army, in response to the new government's refusal to adopt a federal system.

""They have gone back"": Members of the CPB's delegation to the failed 1963 peace talks, returning to their bases by foot, c. November 1963.

Many insurgent groups, communist and ethnonationalist alike, became increasingly receptive of the Maoist concept of a ""people's war"" after failed peace talks with Ne Win's government in 1963. The CPB maintained close relations with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and replicated China's Cultural Revolution.[24] The CPB's imitation of their Chinese allies was perceived by many Burmese as an attempt by China to intrude into Burmese affairs, a sentiment which led to the violent 1967 anti-Chinese riots in Burma. By the time the riots were quelled, 31 Chinese civilians had been killed and several Chinese-owned businesses had been burned down.

Both immediately after the coup and again in 1972, Ne Win held peace talks with several insurgent groups, but both times they fell apart. This was partly due to Ne Win's refusal to adopt a federal multi-party system. After negotiations failed, defectors from the Tatmadaw and ethnic insurgents walked back to their bases, with headlines across Myanmar famously reading ""They have gone back"" (သူတို့ပြန်ကြလေပြီ). Private property was confiscated by the government, and the Burmese Socialist Programme Party (BSPP) was founded in 1974 to govern the country under a one-party system. Under Ne Win's 26-year dictatorship, Myanmar became an isolated hermit kingdom and one of the least developed countries in the world. In 1988, nationwide student protests resulted in the BSPP and Ne Win being ousted and replaced with a new military regime, the State Peace and Development Council.[page needed]

8888 Uprising [ edit ]

On 12 March 1988, students began demonstrating in Rangoon (present-day Yangon) against the totalitarian rule of Ne Win and his Burma Socialist Programme Party (BSPP).[28] The protests quickly spread across the country, and the BSPP government was eventually pressured into adopting a multi-party system.[29] However, the BSPP government was overthrown in a military coup d'état on 18 September 1988. The military then established the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) and violently cracked down on protesters, ending all demonstrations by 21 September 1988.[30]

Authorities in Myanmar claimed that around 350 people were killed,[31][32] while opposition groups claimed thousands died in the protests at the hands of the military.[33][34][35] According to The Economist, over 3,000 people were killed in the demonstrations.[36] Despite its violent suppression of the 8888 Uprising, the new military junta agreed to ceasefire agreements with certain insurgent groups after the demonstrations ceased.

Aung San Suu Kyi emerged from the 8888 Uprising as a symbol of Myanmar's pro-democracy movement, leading the country's largest opposition party, the National League for Democracy (NLD). The military junta arranged a general election in 1990 to elect members of a parliament-sized constitutional committee which would draft a new constitution. The NLD won a supermajority of the seats, but the military junta, surprised by the outcome, refused to recognise the results and placed Aung San Suu Kyi under house arrest.

SLORC / SPDC junta (1988–2011) [ edit ]

Map of insurgent activity in Burma in 1989

After voiding the results of the 1990 election, the military junta consolidated its rule over Myanmar. The SLORC was abolished in 1997 and replaced with the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), which consisted of eleven senior military officers.[page needed]

In the 1990s, the Tatmadaw severely weakened ethnic insurgent groups, destroying most of their bases and strongholds.

In 2006, the Tatmadaw launched a large-scale military offensive against the KNU's armed wing, the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA). The clashes resulted in the displacement of hundreds of thousands of civilians in Kayin State. According to one estimate, approximately half a million people were displaced due to fighting between government forces and the KNU, and the forcible relocation of villages by the government.[41][42]

In 2007, hundreds of thousands of monks protested against the military junta's rule, and called for free elections, minority rights and the release of political prisoners in an event now known as the Saffron Revolution.[43] The protest originally began in response to the government's removal of price subsidies for compressed natural gas.[44]

The Tatmadaw attacked Kokang in 2009, causing the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army to lose control of the area and forcing 30,000 refugees to flee to neighbouring Yunnan, China.[45]

In 2010, Tatmadaw forces clashed violently with DKBA-5, resulting in nearly 10,000 refugees fleeing to Thailand to escape the violent conflict.

Civilian government (2011–2021) [ edit ]

The government introduced a new constitution in 2008 and instigated a period of political reforms from 2011 to 2015, with thousands of political prisoners being released, including Aung San Suu Kyi. The 2008 constitution created five self-administered zones and one self-administered division for six ethnic minority groups.[46] In November 2014, the NLD attempted to make amendments to the constitution, in response to a clause that made Aung San Suu Kyi ineligible to become President of Myanmar if her party won an election. These amendments however, were rejected.[47]

In 2013, large anti-Muslim riots flared up in various cities across Myanmar. The violence coincided with the rise of the Buddhist nationalist 969 Movement, led by Sayadaw U Wirathu.[48]

In early 2015, the Burmese government invited 15 insurgent groups to negotiate a ""Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement"". The draft was agreed upon by a majority of the invited parties on 31 March 2015,[49] and the agreement was signed by Burmese president Thein Sein and the leaders of eight insurgent groups on 15 October 2015.[50]

In Shan State, the military continued to engage the MNDAA during the 2015 Kokang offensive.

After the end of political reforms in 2015, the government began hosting a number of peace conferences, including the Union Peace Conference – 21st Century Panglong. The first session of the conference was held in 2016, with three follow-up sessions held in 2017, 2018, and 2020.[51] The conference was criticised by opposition groups, including some attendees, for not addressing the main proposals made by ceasefire groups, and for excluding the country's largest insurgent groups which remained actively hostile.[52][53] Critics further argued that Myanmar's constitution granted too much power to the military, and was preventing the country from achieving peace and meaningful democratic reforms.[54][55]

On 9 October 2016, the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) launched its first attack on Burmese border posts along the Bangladesh–Myanmar border, killing nine border officers.[56] This prompted the Tatmadaw to begin massive ""clearance operations"" in northern Rakhine State, which intensified following a second large-scale attack by ARSA on 25 August 2017.[57][58][59] The subsequent violence has sparked international outcry and was described as an ethnic cleansing by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.[60][61]

In late November 2016, the Northern Alliance—which consists of four insurgent groups, the Arakan Army (AA), the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA) and the Ta'ang National Liberation Army (TNLA)—attacked towns and border posts along the China–Myanmar border in Muse Township, northern Shan State.[62][63] The insurgents captured the town of Mong Ko on 25 November 2016[64] and maintained control of it until they withdrew from the town on 4 December 2016 to avoid civilian casualties from airstrikes by the Myanmar Air Force.[65][66]

On 15 August 2019, Northern Alliance insurgents attacked a military college in Nawnghkio Township, killing 15.[67][68][69][70] Further clashes occurred in the following days,[71][72][73][74] with Myanmar's military warning there could be a ""full-scale war"" in Shan State if the Northern Alliance did not halt their attacks.[75]

SAC junta (2021–present) [ edit ]

On the early morning of 1 February 2021, the civilian government led by the NLD was overthrown in a military coup d'état, and the Tatmadaw's commander-in-chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, became the head of state. Aung San Suu Kyi and several other senior members of her government were arrested by the military during the coup.[76] Mass protests followed, with demonstrators demanding the resignation of Min Aung Hlaing and the newly created State Administration Council (SAC), the release of those arrested in the coup, and the restoration of the civilian government.[77]

Anti-coup protesters have armed themselves with slingshots, molotov cocktails, and makeshift shields.[78] In late March 2021, it was reported that dozens of protesters had travelled to Myanmar's border areas to train under one of the country's many insurgent groups, elevating the risk of a countrywide civil war.[79] The civilian government-in-exile, the Committee Representing the Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH), has proposed the formation of a ""federal armed force"" to combat the military.[78]

One of the first instances of armed resistance by protesters occurred in and around the town of Kalay, Sagaing Region. After the Tatmadaw raided a protest camp in Kalay on 28 March 2021, protesters fought back with hunting rifles and homemade firearms.[80] Several insurgent groups, notably the Kachin Independence Army and the Karen National Liberation Army, have also resumed or escalated their attacks against the Tatmadaw in response to the coup.[81][82]

Map of insurgent activity in Myanmar in December 2023

Seven signatories of the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement announced on 4 April 2021 that they had decided to join the National Unity Government, including the All Burma Student Democratic Front and the Karen National Union.[83] Some of the groups have resumed hostilities towards the junta government.

The Chinland Defence Force began its armed resistance in Mindat and Hakha, Chin State, on 26 April 2021.[84]

On 5 May 2021, the National Unity Government declared the formation of an armed wing, the People's Defence Force (PDF), to protect its supporters from military junta attacks and as a first step towards a Federal Union Army.[85] It clashed with the Tatmadaw in the town of Muse on 23 May, killing at least 13 members of Myanmar's security forces.[86][87] Members of the Karenni People's Defence Force (KPDF) in Kayah State also clashed with the Tatmadaw near the state capital of Loikaw.[88][89]

The Communist Party of Burma rearmed itself and announced the creation of its new armed wing, the People's Liberation Army, in late 2021.[90][91]

ACLED estimated that 11,000 people had been killed from February to December 2021.[92]

Conflict by state or region [ edit ]

Chin State and Sagaing Region [ edit ]

The Mizo people of Mizoram, India, the Chin people of Myanmar, and the Kuki people are all Zo people who share a common culture and history.

In 1960, the Chin Liberation Army was founded by Tun Kho Pum Baite to unify the Chin-inhabited areas, while the Mizo National Front (MNF) fought for Mizo independence. The Chin National Army (CNF) was formed in 1988. It signed a ceasefire agreement with the Chin State government in 2012. The Kuki National Army (KNA) was also founded in 1988 with the goal of creating Kuki autonomy in Myanmar and India.

Several separatist groups fighting the Indian government in Northeast India also operate from bases in Myanmar, such as the Zomi Revolutionary Army, the United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA), and the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN). These groups frequently cross into India via the porous border.[93]

In June 2019, Tatmadaw troops, in coordination with the Indian Army, carried out operations against the NSCN headquarters in Taga, in the Naga Self-Administered Zone of Sagaing Region.[94]

Kachin State [ edit ]

The Kachin people are a major ethnic minority in Myanmar who primarily inhabit the mountainous northern regions of the Kachin Hills in Kachin State. Kachin regular soldiers previously formed a significant part of the Myanmar Army; however, after Ne Win's regime seized power in 1962, many Kachin soldiers defected from the military and reorganised with already active Kachin insurgents to form the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), under the Kachin Independence Organisation (KIO). Religious tensions have also been a source of conflict, as Kachin people have historically been predominantly Christian, while the majority Bamar people have been predominantly Buddhist.[95]

Ceasefire agreements have been signed between the KIA and the government several times; most notably a ceasefire signed in 1994, that lasted for 17 years until June 2011, when government forces attacked KIA positions along the Taping River, east of Bhamo, Kachin State.[96] As a result of the ceasefire breakdown, Kachin State has faced waves of internal displacement, with over 90,000 internally displaced people spread across over 150 camps or camp-like settings as of April 2017. Many IDP camps are located in non-government controlled areas with severely restricted access.[97] The Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) estimates that in April and May 2018, over 14,000 people were displaced from fighting between the KIA and the Tatmadaw.[98]

Clashes between the KIA and the Tatmadaw in 2012 resulted in around 2,500 casualties (both civilian and military), 211 of whom were government soldiers. The violence resulted in the displacement of nearly 100,000 civilians and the complete or partial abandonment of 364 villages.[99][100][101][102][103]

Government forces attacked the Kachin Independence Army's headquarters near the city of Laiza on 19 November 2014, killing at least 22 KIA insurgents, according to the government.[104]

N'Ban La became the KIO's chairman and the KIA's second-in-command in January 2018. Htang Gam Shawng retained his position as the KIA's commander-in-chief.[105]

Kayah State [ edit ]

In 1957, pro-independence groups in Karenni State (present-day Kayah State) founded the Karenni National Progressive Party (KNPP). An accompanying armed wing, the Karenni Army, was established shortly after to fight for the self-determination of the Karenni people.[106] The Karenni Army and Tatmadaw have fought in the region ever since, apart from a brief three-month ceasefire in 1995.[107] Rivals to the KNPP include the leftist Kayan New Land Party (KNLP) and Karenni National People's Liberation Front (KNPLF), both of whom signed ceasefires with the government in the 1990s.[108][109]

The Karenni Army is currently led by General Bee Htoo,[106] and consists of roughly between 500[page needed] and 1,500 troops.

The conflict escalated following the 2021 military coup, with the civilian-led Karenni People's Defence Force (KPDF) opening up a new front in northern Kayah State. After Tatmadaw troops attacked and burned down several villages in the region, KPDF fighters launched an offensive against the Tatmadaw, seizing and destroying several military outposts.[112]

Kayin State [ edit ]

The Karen people of Kayin State (formerly Karen State) in eastern Myanmar are the third largest ethnic group in Myanmar, consisting of roughly 7% of the country's total population. Karen insurgent groups have fought for independence and self-determination since 1949. In 1949, the commander-in-chief of the Tatmadaw General Smith Dun, an ethnic Karen, was fired because of the rise of Karen opposition groups, which furthered ethnic tensions. He was replaced by Ne Win, a Bamar nationalist who would later rule Myanmar as a military dictator.

The government of Myanmar has been accused of using ""scorched earth"" tactics against Karen civilians in the past, including (but not limited to) burning down entire villages, planting land mines, using civilians as slave labour, using civilians as minesweepers and the rape and murder of Karen women.[114] According to a report by legal firm DLA Piper, whose report was presented to the United Nations Security Council, these tactics against the Karen can be identified as ethnic cleansing. The government had however, denied these claims.[115]

The initial aim of the Karen National Union (KNU) and its armed wing the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA) was to create independent state for the Karen people. However, since 1976 they have instead called for a federal union with fair Karen representation and the self-determination of the Karen people.[21]

In 1995, the main headquarters and operating bases of the KNU were mostly destroyed or captured by the government, forcing the KNLA to operate from the jungles of Kayin State. Until 1995, the Thai government supported insurgents across the Myanmar–Thailand border, but soon stopped its support due to a new major economic deal with Myanmar.[116]

The KNU signed the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement with the government of Myanmar on 15 October 2015, along with seven other insurgent groups.[117] However, in March 2018, the government of Myanmar violated the agreement by sending 400 Tatmadaw soldiers into KNU-held territory to build a road connecting two military bases.[118] Armed clashes erupted between the KNU and the Myanmar Army in the Ler Mu Plaw area of Hpapun District, resulting in the displacement of 2,000 people.[119] On 17 May 2018, the Tatmadaw agreed to ""temporarily postpone"" their road project and to withdraw troops from the area.[120]

The KNU resumed its fight against the Myanmar government following the 2021 military coup. On 27 April 2021, KNU insurgents captured a military base on the west bank of the Salween River, which forms Myanmar's border with Thailand. The Tatmadaw later retaliated with airstrikes on KNU positions. There were no casualties reported by either side.[82]

Mon State [ edit ]

The Mon people have sought self-determination since Myanmar gained independence in 1948, initially under the Mon People's Front and from 1962 through the New Mon State Party (NMSP). The Mon National Liberation Army (MNLA) has been fighting government forces since 1949. It signed the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement in 2015 and has had minor skirmishes with the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA).

Rakhine State [ edit ]

Rakhine insurgency [ edit ]

Insurgent groups of the Rakhine (or Arakanese),[121] Chin,[122] and Rohingya[123] ethnic minorities have fought against the government for self-determination in Rakhine State since the early 1950s. The region was a stronghold of the Red Flag Communist Party until its defeat by the Tatmadaw in 1978. Its successor, the Communist Party of Arakan continued to wage an insurgency in Rakhine State until the 1990s.[124]

Ethnic Rakhine insurgent groups, such as the Arakan Army and Arakan Liberation Army (ALA), continue to fight against the government, though major violence has been rare since political reforms and peace talks.[when?] The Arakan Army, founded in 2009, is currently the largest insurgent group in Rakhine State, with around 7,000 fighters.[125]

On 4 January 2019, around 300 Arakan Army insurgents launched pre-dawn attacks on four border police outposts—Kyaung Taung, Nga Myin Taw, Ka Htee La and Kone Myint—in northern Buthidaung Township.[126] Thirteen members of the Border Guard Police (BGP) were killed and nine others were injured,[127][128][129] while 40 firearms and more than 10,000 rounds of ammunition were looted. The Arakan Army later stated that it had captured nine BGP personnel and five civilians, and that three of its fighters were also killed in the attacks.[130][131]

Following the attacks, the Office of the President of Myanmar held a high-level meeting on national security in the capital Naypyidaw on 7 January 2019, and instructed the Defence Ministry to increase troop deployments in the areas that were attacked and to use aircraft if necessary.[132] Subsequent clashes between the Myanmar Army and the Arakan Army were reported in Maungdaw, Buthidaung, Kyauktaw, Rathedaung and Ponnagyun Townships, forcing out over 5,000 civilians from their homes,[133][134] hundreds of whom (mostly Rakhine and Khami) have fled across the border into Bangladesh.[135] Civilian casualties,[136][137] arbitrary beatings[138] and detentions of ethnic Rakhines,[139] forced seizures of property,[140] and blockage of food aid and medical relief by the Tatmadaw have also been reported.[141]

Rohingya insurgency [ edit ]

Rohingya insurgents have been fighting against local government forces and other insurgent groups in northern Rakhine State since 1948, with ongoing religious violence between the predominantly Muslim Rohingyas and the Buddhist Rakhines fuelling the conflict.[citation needed]

Following the independence of Myanmar, Rohingya mujahideen fought against government forces in an attempt to secede and annex Rohingya-inhabited regions to East Pakistan. Between 1949 and 1954, the Burmese military launched several operations in order to regain control of the region. By the end of the 1950s, the mujahideen had lost most of their momentum and support, and most of their fighters had surrendered by 1961.[citation needed]

Ne Win's military junta turned increasingly hostile towards the Rohingyas. The authorities launched large-scale military operations in order to expel insurgents and so-called ""foreigners"" from Arakan, such as Operation Dragon King in 1978 and Operation Pyi Thaya in 1991[142]

The legal and political rights of the Rohingya people have been an underlying issue during the conflict, with spontaneous bouts of violence, such as the 2012 Rakhine State riots and the 2013 Myanmar anti-Muslim riots, periodically occurring as a result. Despite making up the majority of the population in the three northern townships of Rakhine State,[123] the Rohingyas are frequently the targets of religiously motivated attacks. The 1982 Nationality law did not recognise the Rohingyas as an ethnic group which is native to Myanmar.[142] As a result, the Rohingyas cannot apply for Burmese citizenship and few laws exist to protect their rights.[143]

On 9 October 2016, unidentified insurgents attacked three Burmese border posts along Myanmar's border with Bangladesh, starting a new armed conflict in northern Rakhine State. According to government officials in the border town of Maungdaw, the attackers looted several dozen firearms and ammunition from the border posts, and they also brandished knives and homemade slingshots that fired metal bolts. The attacks left nine border officers and ""several insurgents"" dead.[56] On 11 October 2016, four Tatmadaw soldiers were killed on the third day of fighting.[144] A newly emerging insurgent group, the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), claimed responsibility for the attacks a week later.[145]

During the early hours of 25 August 2017, ARSA insurgents launched coordinated attacks on 24 police posts and the 552nd Light Infantry Battalion army base, killing a dozen people.[57][58][59] In response, the Tatmadaw launched ""clearance operations"" in northern Rakhine State, which critics argued targeted Rohingya civilians rather than insurgents.[146][147][148] Following the violence, 200,000 civilians remained trapped in the region without adequate access to markets, livelihoods, services and medical care.[149][150]

Shan State [ edit ]

The Shan people are the largest ethnic group in Shan State and the second largest in Myanmar. They were one of several ethnic groups consulted by Aung San during negotiations leading up to the Panglong Agreement, which gave the Shan leaders the option to split from Myanmar a decade after independence if they were unsatisfied with the central government.[17] This was, however, not honoured by the post-independence government following Aung San's assassination.

Frustrated by a decade of fruitless negotiations, a group of 39 Shan led by Saw Yanda (a Shan from Yunnan, China; also known as Chao Noi, Sao Noi, and Saw Yanna) formed an armed resistance movement on 21 May 1958.[152] It became known as the Noom Suk Harn (or Noom Seik Harn ), meaning ""brave young warriors"".[152] In 1960, the movement suffered an internal split between the ""rough and uneducated"" Saw Yanda and a group of young intellectuals, and the latter subsequently formed the Shan State Independence Army (SSIA). Aside from the remnants of the Noom Suk Harn and the SSIA, there was also the Shan National United Front (SNUF), which operated primarily in southern Shan State. The SSIA, the SNUF, and the Kokang Force (a local army consisting of Kokang Chinese) agreed to merge into the Shan State Army (SSA) in 1964. Sao Nang Hearn Kham, the Mahadevi (queen consort) of Yawnghwe, was elected chairperson of its political wing, the Shan State War Council (SSWC). The SSWC was replaced by the Shan State Progress Party (SSPP) on 16 August 1971.

In northern Shan State, the SSA came into conflict with the Communist Party of Burma (CPB), which had long been active along Burma's border with China. During the 1960s, the Burma Army began the Ka Kew Ye (KKY) program, which recruited ethnic armies to combat communist insurgents, and in return, they would be permitted to engage in cross-border trade on their own terms. This led to many units of the SSA defecting to the KKY militias. The SSA also worked with opium warlords such as Lo Hsing Han and Khun Sa. Internal divisions resulted in the SSA fracturing into many factions, and it collapsed in mid-1976. The SSPP later formed the pro-communist Shan State Army – North (SSA-N) to continue the insurgency. After the CPB suffered an internal mutiny and collapsed in April 1989, the SSA-N signed a ceasefire agreement with the government in exchange for autonomy over the areas it controlled (officially called ""Special Region 3 of Shan State""). A splinter group led by Sai Leun which broke away from the CPB at the same time established the National Democratic Alliance Army (NDAA), which controls the Mong La area (Special Region 4) of Shan State.[citation needed]

In the 1960s, Khun Sa, a KKY militia leader, was permitted by the Burmese government to grow and traffic opium in return for fighting Shan and communists insurgents. He gradually became one of the most powerful insurgent leaders in Shan State. Khun Sa was captured by the Tatmadaw after plotting with the SSA in 1969, but was later released to Thailand, where he built an army near the Burmese border and became the dominant opium warlord in the Golden Triangle. After being expelled by the Thai Army in 1982, Khun Sa returned to Burma and formed the Mong Tai Army (MTA) in 1985. In the 1990s, the MTA became the dominant Shan fighting force with peak strength of 20,000 soldiers. In 1991, Khun Sa declared the creation of an independent Shan State, with himself as president. However, some Shan nationalists in the MTA disagreed with his leadership and formed a rival Shan organisation, the Shan State National Army (SSNA).[157] The Mong Tai Army was quickly disbanded after the mass desertion, and Khun Sa himself surrendered to the government in 1996. He was allowed to retire in Yangon and keep his large fortune.

Refusing to surrender with Khun Sa and the MTA, Lieutenant General Yawd Serk of the Shan United Revolutionary Army (SURA) led 800 soldiers under his command to central Shan State and established the Shan State Army – South (SSA-S) on 26 January 1996. He then recruited roughly a thousand more soldiers before returning to southern Shan State to establish the group's headquarters in Loi Tai Leng. The SSA-S has since become one of the largest Shan insurgent groups in Myanmar, and has around 8,000 soldiers as of 2016.[158] Yawd Serk lead the group until his retirement on 2 February 2014. Its political wing is the Restoration Council of Shan State. The SSA-S maintains a number of bases along the Myanmar–Thailand border, and signed a ceasefire agreement with the government on 2 December 2011.[159]

The Tatmadaw launched a military offensive named Operation Perseverance (ဇွဲမန်ဟိန်း) against insurgents in Shan State in 2011.[160] During the offensive, the Tatmadaw captured territory from the NDAA and the SSA-N, with the latter being involved in most of the fighting.[161][162] While this operation was officially a response to the groups' rejections of the junta's ""One Nation, One Army"" policy,[163][164][165][166] researchers have linked it to the military's interests in the jade trade.[168]

In October 2015, the Tatmadaw launched a military offensive to seize territory granted to the SSA-N under a previous ceasefire. The Tatmadaw used heavy artillery and airstrikes, displacing thousands of civilians.[169]

Other ethnic armed groups in the region include the Lahu Democratic Union, the Ta'ang National Liberation Army, the Wa National Army and the Pa-O National Liberation Army, of varying sizes and affiliations.

Kokang [ edit ]

From the 1960s to 1989, the Kokang area in northern Shan state was controlled by the Communist Party of Burma, and after the party's armed wing disbanded in 1989 it became a special region of Myanmar under the control of the Myanmar Nationalities Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA). The MNDAA is a Kokang insurgent group active in the Kokang Self-Administered Zone in northern Shan State. The group signed a ceasefire agreement with the government in 1989, the same year it was founded, which lasted for two decades until 2009, when government troops entered MNDAA territory in an attempt to stop the flow of drugs through the area.[170] Violence erupted again in 2015, when the MNDAA attempted to retake territory it had lost in 2009.[171][172] The MNDAA clashed with government troops once again in 2017.[173][174]

The MNDAA resumed its fight against the Tatmadaw in response to the 2021 coup d'état. The MNDAA and Ta'ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) have carried out several joint attacks against the Tatmadaw in Shan State.[175]

Wa State [ edit ]

Following the CPB's internal mutiny on 16 April 1989, ethnic Wa cadres under the command of Bao Youxiang announced their split from the party and the founding of the United Wa State Party and United Wa State Army. The UWSA signed a ceasefire agreement with the then-ruling military junta in May 1989 and has since governed parts of Shan State as the autonomous Wa State. The Burmese government has accused their Chinese counterpart of heavily supporting Wa State and the UWSA.[176]

Foreign support [ edit ]

China [ edit ]

The People's Republic of China has long been accused of having a multifaceted role in the conflict, given its close relations with both the Myanmar government and insurgent groups active along the China–Myanmar border.[177]

China openly supported the Communist Party of Burma (CPB) and its pursuit of Mao Zedong Thought during the 1960s and 1970s.[179][180] After the CPB's armed wing agreed to disarm in 1988, China was accused by Myanmar of continuing to support insurgent groups operating along its border, such as the United Wa State Army[182] and Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, the latter enjoying closer ties to China due to a common Han Chinese ethnic background.[183]

In 2016, China pledged to support Myanmar's peace process by encouraging China-friendly insurgent groups to attend peace talks with the Burmese government and by sending more soldiers to secure its border with Myanmar.[184][185][186] China also offered $3 million USD to fund the negotiations. However, the Burmese government has expressed suspicion over China's involvement in the peace process, due to China's alleged links to the Northern Alliance and the United Wa State Army.[187]

India [ edit ]

India and Myanmar share a strategic military relationship due to the overlapping insurgency in Northeast India.[94][188] India has provided Myanmar's military with training, weapons, and tactical equipment.[189] The two countries' armies have conducted joint operations against insurgents at their border since the 1990s.[190] Myanmar has also taken an active role in finding and arresting insurgents that fled from northeast India; in May 2020 Myanmar handed over 22 insurgents, included several top commanders, to Indian authorities.[191] Similarly, India has been one of the few countries to forcefully repatriate Rohingya refugees back to Myanmar despite global outcry.[192]

Pakistan [ edit ]

From 1948 to 1950, Pakistan sent aid to mujahideen in northern Arakan (present-day Rakhine State). In 1950, the Pakistani government warned their Burmese counterparts about their treatment of Muslims. In response, Burmese Prime Minister U Nu immediately sent a Muslim diplomat, Pe Khin, to negotiate a memorandum of understanding. Pakistan agreed to cease aid to the mujahideen and arrest members of the group. In 1954, mujahid leader Mir Kassem was arrested by Pakistani authorities, and many of his followers later surrendered to the Burmese government.[193]

The International Crisis Group reported on 14 December 2016 that in interviews with the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), its leaders claimed to have links to private donors in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. The ICG also released unconfirmed reports that Rohingya villagers had been ""secretly trained"" by Afghan and Pakistani fighters.[194][195] In September 2017, Bangladeshi sources stated that the possibility of cooperation between Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and ARSA was ""extremely high"".[196]

Russia [ edit ]

In November 2013, delegations from the Burmese and Russian armed forces met in Naypyidaw and agreed to strengthen cooperation between the two, particularly in regards to the exchange of military technology.[197] Myanmar and Russia signed a military cooperation agreement in June 2016, with Russia promising more arms and training for Myanmar's military.[198]

Thailand [ edit ]

Thailand had been a vocal supporter of various insurgent groups in Myanmar, condemning the actions of the then-ruling military juntas and allowing weapons and ammunition to be smuggled through its border. However, in 1995, the Thai government secured its border with Myanmar and stopped all logistical support going through Thailand after they signed a major economic deal with Myanmar.[116]

United States [ edit ]

The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) began aiding Kuomintang soldiers that fled to Myanmar from China following the advance of Chinese communist forces into Yunnan in 1951. This included Operation Paper, which involved supplying them with non-lethal aid via Thailand until 1953, when they airlifted 7,000 soldiers to Taiwan and ended the operation.

Yugoslavia [ edit ]

Yugoslavia became the primary arms supplier for the Burmese government beginning in 1952, when the Burmese reached out to Belgrade due to the slow and uneasy support from the United States and the United Kingdom.[201][203] The two nations became very close as a result, and the Yugoslav People's Army sent advisors to assist on the frontlines.[204] The sudden strong relationship between Burma and Yugoslavia prompted concern among the Americans, who worried the Yugoslav support would strengthen Marxist ideology in the government.[205] Ne Win, who previously sought support solely from the West, was impressed with the speed of the Burmese–Yugoslav cooperation, and travelled to Belgrade in 1953.[206]

Arms suppliers [ edit ]

As of 2019, Myanmar's military is supplied by fourteen arms companies from seven countries: China, India, Israel, North Korea, the Philippines, Russia, and Ukraine.[208][209]

Despite Serbia signing a non-binding UN resolution calling for the cessation of arms sales to Myanmar following the 2021 Myanmar coup d'état, hundreds of Serbian-made 80 mm rockets were sent from Belgrade to Yangon less than a week after the coup.[210]

Vietnam has also been a vocal supporter of modernisation efforts by Myanmar's military, providing them with ammunition and military hardware.[211] Burmese military officials have also toured Vietnam to receive military advice from their counterparts in the People's Army of Vietnam.[212]

Foreign fighters [ edit ]

Dave Everett was a member of the Australian Special Air Service Regiment before leaving in 1986 and joining the Karen National Liberation Army as a mercenary. Everett fought alongside the KNLA under the alias ""Steve"" and trained insurgents, helping them improve their marksmanship and teaching them how to use claymore anti-personnel mines. To fund his time with the KNLA, Everett perpetrated several robberies in Australia with the help of accomplices and took piloting lessons so he could smuggle weapons into Myanmar. Everett returned to Australia a year later in 1987.[213]

Former members of the British special forces, Australian special forces, Green berets, French Foreign Legion, and Russian Spetsnaz have also been reported fighting alongside insurgents as recently as 2012.[214]

Ceasefire attempts [ edit ]

A number of insurgent groups have negotiated ceasefires and peace agreements with successive governments, but most have since fallen apart.

Under the new constitutional reforms in 2011, state level and union level ceasefire agreements were made with a number of insurgent groups. Fourteen of the 17 largest rebel factions signed a ceasefire agreement with the new reformed government. All of the 14 signatories wanted negotiations in accordance with the Panglong Agreement of 1947, which granted self-determination, a federal system of government (meaning regional autonomy), religious freedom and ethnic minority rights. However, the new constitution, only had a few clauses dedicated to minority rights, and therefore, the government discussed with rebel factions using the new constitution for reference, rather than the Panglong Agreement. There was no inclusive plan or body that represented all the factions, and as a result, in resent, the KNU backed out of the conference and complained the lack of independence for each party within the ethnic bloc.[217] However, most of the negotiations between the State Peace Deal Commission and rebel factions were formal and peaceful.[218]

On 31 March 2015, a draft of the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA) was finalised between representatives from eight insurgent groups (all part of the Nationwide Ceasefire Coordination Team or NCCT) and the government of Myanmar.[219] However, only eight of the 15 insurgent groups signed the final agreement on 15 October 2015.[117] The signing was witnessed by observers and delegates from the United Nations, the United Kingdom, Norway, Japan and the United States.[41][42] Two other insurgent groups later joined the agreement on 13 February 2018.[220][221][222][223]

The Union Peace Conference – 21st Century Panglong was held from 31 August to 4 September 2016 with several different organisations as representatives, in an attempt to mediate between the government and different insurgent groups. Talks ended without any agreement being reached.[224] The name of the conference was a reference to the original Panglong Conference held during British rule in 1947, which was negotiated between Aung San and ethnic leaders.[225]

Human rights violations [ edit ]

The Tatmadaw have been accused of using ""scorched earth"" tactics against civilians. The accusations include burning down entire villages, planting landmines, using civilians as slave labour, using civilians as minesweepers, and using civilians as sex slaves.[114] According to a report by legal firm DLA Piper, whose report was presented to the United Nations Security Council, these tactics have been identified as ethnic cleansing.[115]

Both sides have been accused of using landmines, which have caused hundreds of accidental civilian injuries and deaths. The KNU has been accused of planting landmines in rural areas, most of which have not been disarmed. The KNU claims that landmines are vital for repelling government troops because they ""discourage [the Tatmadaw] from attacking civilians"". However, the majority of those who fall victim to landmines planted by the KNU are local civilians and not government soldiers.[226] Victims of landmines must travel to the Myanmar–Thailand border to seek treatment, as local hospitals and facilities lack proper equipment and funding.[227]

Both sides have also been accused of using thousands of child soldiers, despite the fact that the government of Myanmar and seven insurgent groups signed an agreement with UNICEF in 2012, promising not to exploit children for military and political gains. The International Labour Organization (ILO) has accused both sides of continuing to use child soldiers in violation of the agreement. According to the ILO, the Tatmadaw has discharged hundreds of child soldiers since 2012; however, the ILO also estimated that at least 340 child soldiers had been recruited by the Tatmadaw between 2013 and 2014.[228] Meanwhile, insurgent groups such as the MNDAA, SSA-S, and TNLA have reportedly press-ganged minors into their armies.[229]

One of the most notable cases in which child soldiers were used in Myanmar was that of twins Johnny and Luther Htoo, the leaders of God's Army, a former rebel faction. When God's Army was formed in 1997, the pair were just ten-years-old.[230]

On 25 July 2022, the Human Rights Watch reported that Myanmar's military junta sentenced four men to death after closed trials that fell far short of international standards. The men put to death were Phyo Zeya Thaw, Kyaw Min Yu, Hla Myo Aung and Aung Thura Zaw. These executions followed grossly unjust and politically motivated military trials.[231]

Casualties and displacement of civilians [ edit ]

An estimated 130,000 people died in the conflict from 1948 to 2011.[3] The Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED) has recorded over 53,000 deaths since 2011.[4]

The conflict has also resulted in the displacement of a large number of civilians, many of whom have fled to neighbouring countries such as Thailand, China, India, and Bangladesh. The persecution of Rohingya people and other ethnic minorities after the 1962 coup led to the expulsion of nearly 300,000 people. The UN estimated that between 1996 and 2006, around 1 million people were internally displaced inside Myanmar, over 230,000 of whom remain displaced in the southeast of the country, and 128,000 refugees lived in temporary shelters on the Myanmar–Thailand border.[234][235] In August 2007, approximately 160,000 refugees fled to nine refugee camps along the Myanmar–Thailand border and the Thai border provinces of Chiang Mai and Ratchaburi. Approximately 62% of the refugee population consisted of displaced Karen people. Humanitarian organisations such as Doctors Without Borders have since sent workers and medical support to the refugees.[236] As of 2014 , an estimated 600,000 to 1 million people remain internally displaced in Myanmar.[page needed]

Over the course of the conflict, government officials in Myanmar have been accused of forcefully removing civilians living in conflict areas and confiscating their property, to repurpose them for commercial, industrial, and military projects.[234][238][239]

In Rakhine State, there were around 75,000 internally displaced Rohingyas in 2012, according to Refugee International.[240] UNICEF has reported that living conditions in Rohingya refugee camps in Rakhine State are ""wholly inadequate"" and lacks access to basic services.[241] In October 2017, there were an estimated 947,000 Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh.[242] The Rohingya people have been described by the United Nations as ""among the world's least wanted"" and ""one of the world's most persecuted minorities.""

The Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre reports a total of 401,000 people internally displaced in Myanmar as of 2018, owing both to man-made and natural disasters as well as conflict and violence.[98] This figure includes IDPs across the country, with 131,000 in Rakhine State, 97,000 in Kachin State, 50,000 in Kayin State, 40,000 in Tanintharyi Region, 27,000 in Karenni State, 22,000 in Bago Region, 18,000 in Mon State, 15,000 in Shan State and 1,300 in Chin State.[244] Of these total displacements, IDMC estimates that approximately 42,000 people were newly displaced in 2018 by conflict and violence.[98] Compared to 2017, the rate of new displacements was lower in Rakhine State but higher in Kachin State and northern Shan State, which together saw approximately 36,000 people displaced.[98]

The Global Camp Coordination and Camp Management Cluster (CCCM) estimated in 2019 that at least 941,000 people in Myanmar were in need of humanitarian assistance, with over 128,000 people living in IDP camps in Rakhine State and over 105,000 people displaced in Kachin State and northern Shan State.[245] While many displacements last only for the duration of active fighting, protracted displacement is evidenced by camps in Kachin State, Rakhine State, and Shan State.[98] Living situations in these camps are often overcrowded with inadequate shelter, sanitation, healthcare, food, and education.[246] In total, approximately 35 per cent of IDPs in Myanmar are estimated to live in non-government controlled areas that have limited if not wholly restricted access as of November 2019, complicating relief efforts both for international and local organisations.[245]

International responses [ edit ]

Since 1991, the UN General Assembly has adopted twenty-five different resolutions regarding Myanmar's government, condemning previous military juntas for their systematic violations of human rights and lack of political freedom.[247] In 2009 they urged the then ruling junta to take urgent measures to end violations of international human rights and humanitarian laws in the country.[248]

Reports of human rights abuses committed by the military and local paramilitaries prompted the UN Human Rights Council to launch an independent international fact-finding mission in March 2017, with which Myanmar's government failed to cooperate.[249] The mission's report (A/HRC/39/64) released in September 2018 highlighted ""clear patterns"" of serious human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law in Kachin State, Rakhine State, and Shan State since 2011. The Tatmadaw are accused of deliberate and systematic targeting of civilians, sexual violence, discriminatory rhetoric against minorities, and impunity for its soldiers.[246]

Eyewitness testimony alleged that in Rakhine State, ""clearance operations"" by the Tatmadaw amounted to planned and deliberate mass killings in at least 54 locations.[246] Hundreds and perhaps thousands of Rohingya women and girls were reported to have been raped, including in mass gang rapes, and at least 392 Rohingya villages were burned to the ground.[246] The report also highlighted the conviction of Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, two Reuters reporters who had exposed the military's extrajudicial killing of ten Rohingya men and were subsequently imprisoned; the journalists have since been released and awarded a 2019 Pulitzer Prize for their reporting.[250]

In addition to violence against Rohingya communities, the report noted Tatamadaw abuses against ethnic Rakhine, including forced labour, sexual violence, forced evictions, and killings. It also highlighted crimes committed by insurgent groups in Kachin State, Rakhine State, and Shan State, including arson, extortion, destruction of property, forced labour, rape, murder, and forced disappearances.[251] The mission called for an investigation into and the prosecution of military leaders, in particular commander-in-chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, in the International Criminal Court (ICC) for genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes.

The Gambia filed a lawsuit against Myanmar in the International Court of Justice on 11 November 2019. Myanmar State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi defended her country's military generals against accusations of genocide in public hearings in December 2019.[252]

Summary

The military coup in Myanmar on Feb. 1, 2021, has sparked an ongoing civil war between the military junta and over 2,600 rebel groups.



While civilian casualties have risen to over 6,000 and the country is threatened by famine, neighboring states like China are mostly pursuing their own interests in the region.



Elections announced for 2025 could lead to further escalations of violence, and an overthrow of the junta could create a dangerous power vacuum.

Perhaps the most surreal video of a coup ever recorded dates back to Feb. 1, 2021 – the day Myanmar’s military seized power. A young influencer filmed herself performing aerobic exercises at a street intersection in the capital Naypyidaw. In the background, armored military vehicles can be seen rolling toward parliament; the young woman said later that she had thought nothing of it. The video went viral, bringing global attention to Myanmar’s latest military takeover – even among those with little interest in Southeast Asian politics.





Four years ago, the military overthrew the elected government of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, who had pledged to usher in a new democratic era in 2015. The coup was followed by mass protests, and just a few weeks later, the country spiraled into civil war – a conflict that has continued ever since.

«NZZ Pro» – Geopolitical briefing

The situation: Since the 2021 coup, Myanmar has been mired in a bloody civil war, with the military junta, rebels and ethnic militias locked in a battle for control.

Geopolitical dynamics: China, India and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are pursuing their own strategic interests while steering clear of direct intervention – leaving Myanmar a geopolitical tinderbox.

Looking ahead: The election scheduled for 2025 could trigger further violence, while the junta’s collapse risks creating a chaotic power vacuum.





The situation in Myanmar is constantly shifting and remains largely overlooked in the West. The military junta is bombing civilian areas, while rebel forces have pushed their military opponents out of vast swathes of territory. More than 6,000 civilians have been killed, and over three million have been displaced. What is happening in Myanmar right now? And what lies ahead?

The historical backdrop





Understanding Myanmar’s civil war requires a look at its modern history. The country is one of Southeast Asia’s most ethnically diverse, home to roughly 135 distinct groups. Since gaining independence from the British in 1948, there have been repeated armed clashes between the various groups. This is partly due to promises made to various ethnic groups for a degree of autonomy when Myanmar gained independence. However, the state’s founders established a centralized system instead. Historian Thant Myint-U once described Myanmar as an «unfinished nation» where identity struggles have fueled war, poverty and isolation.





From the start, the country’s ruling elite has relied on military power to hold the fragile state together. After independence, their priority was strengthening the armed forces, leading to a stark imbalance between military dominance and weak civilian institutions, as political scientist Aurel Croissant has noted. In 1962, just two years after the initial establishment of a democratically elected government, the generals staged a coup and seized power.





For decades, Myanmar’s military rulers controlled the country – sometimes overtly, sometimes from behind the scenes. In 1988, they executed those who took to the streets to protest for greater freedom. Beyond securing their political grip, the generals also took control of key industries and cemented their influence through structural reforms. In 2008, they altered the constitution to ensure that 25% of parliamentary seats were filled by the military, effectively giving the generals a right of veto. In 2015, the National League for Democracy, led by Aung San Suu Kyi, won the elections. Cautious reforms followed, until the military seized power once again five years later, citing unproven allegations of electoral fraud.





The rebels

Tracking Myanmar’s myriad rebel groups is no easy task. According to the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED), an initiative that collects data on various conflicts around the globe, more than 2,600 groups have emerged since the 2021 coup. Many were founded by local politicians, student activists and protesters who fled into the jungle to wage guerrilla warfare against the army. Ethnic armed organizations had been active in the country before 2021, already engaged in fighting the state and seeking autonomy within their territories. The most important of these are located in the regions of Rakhine, Kachin and in the north of Shan, but also in Kayin in the south of the country.

These ethnic armed organizations have inflicted painful losses on the military in recent months. They now not only control larger areas, but also crucial border crossings – to China in the north and to Bangladesh in the west. Today, the military controls a smaller area of Myanmar than at any time since the 1960s.





These ethnic groups have years of experience in financing their guerrilla warfare, whether through drug trafficking (methamphetamines have replaced heroin as Myanmar's top export) or the overexploitation of natural resources. Their cooperation with newly formed rebel groups has created communities of purpose, with the different groups benefiting from each other. These new groups supply the ethnic armies with an ongoing influx of fighters, and they are consistently attacking military bases together. In turn, the new rebel groups receive training from the ethnic armies and benefit from their combat experience.





This cooperation is fragile, however, and there have been repeated battles between the various insurgents. The groups’ individual war aims diverge as well. Many of the new rebel groups have united under the National Unity Government (NUG), a Myanmar shadow government that has made it its goal to overthrow the junta. The ethnic armed organizations, however, are primarily concerned with controlling their own territories. This is evident from the only tentative advances into the junta-controlled interior of Myanmar, in which the ethnic armies have little interest – partly because they would be vulnerable to the military's airstrikes.

The civilian population





The U.N. estimates the civilian death toll in Myanmar at over 6,000. According to the U.N., 2,000 people alone were executed while in military custody. At least 365 people were shot in the head; 215 were burned alive. International observers are racing to document widespread atrocities – including torture, beheadings, rapes and other crimes against humanity.





«Increasingly frequent and indiscriminate air strikes, artillery and drone attacks have killed civilians, driven survivors from their homes, and destroyed hospitals, schools and places of worship,» writes Nicholas Koumjian, head of the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar, the U.N.'s investigative office for the region. «While most of the evidence the Mechanism has collected concerns crimes committed by the Myanmar military, we are also investigating disturbing reports of atrocities committed by other armed groups, including rape, killings and torture,» he continues.





As if all this were not enough, the country is also on the verge of a famine. The local economy, including agriculture, has collapsed. Next summer 15 million people in Myanmar could be threatened by hunger, warn analysts from IPC, a platform for mapping global hunger.





The neighbors





China plays an important yet undecided role in Myanmar. «China is supporting the junta, even though without enthusiasm, and continues to sell weapons to it. But it also supports to some extent some of the powerful ethnic groups operating along its borders,» says David Mathieson, a longtime Myanmar expert. In 2024, Beijing brokered a ceasefire, but it unraveled within five months. In January, the junta announced a new ceasefire between the military and one of the ethnic armed organizations, with China acting as mediator once again.





In November, junta leader Min Aung Hlaing traveled to China – not for a state visit, but for a regional summit, a move that could signal Beijing’s view of him as a key figure in efforts to manage the crisis. China has no interest in a civil war on its border, and certainly not one with broader geopolitical consequences.





Yet the ethnic armies along the Chinese border hold significant leverage over their neighbor. They control infrastructure and mines built by China that are located in China's sphere of influence. According to Mathieson, China keeps reminding the leaders of these ethnic armies that they should not seek support from the West. China wants to maintain control over conflict mediation along its border and for now, Western peace initiatives are ineffective, he says.





China recognizes that it has influence over Myanmar, says Mathieson, «but it doesn’t want the burden of having to solve a civil war.» It just wants to influence the trajectory of such a war so that it can prioritize its investments and strategic interests.





Meanwhile, the regional powers – the states forming the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) – have struggled for years to find a unified strategy for Myanmar. The only clear consensus appears to be maintaining their economically focused, cooperative union without letting the Myanmar issue cause division. Malaysia has held ASEAN’s annually rotating chairmanship since the start of the year. At an early meeting, the Malaysian foreign minister issued a call for peace, stating somewhat helplessly: «Malaysia wants to know what Myanmar has in mind.»





India, which also shares a border with Myanmar, continues to sell weapons to the junta, despite well-documented human rights violations.





The road ahead

Myanmar’s military junta has announced an election for 2025, but critics argue it is little more than a bid to legitimize its rule. Only parties that have been vetted by the junta are allowed to take part in the election. In addition, only half the country is likely to vote – voter lists could only be drawn up in 145 out of 330 municipalities. But the election is nonetheless set to move forward. Observers warn that violence could escalate in the coming months as the vote approaches. Rebel groups might attack voters and politicians, while the military could seek quick territorial gains to generate success stories ahead of the election.





Beyond domestic control, the junta is also seeking international validation, says Mathieson, particularly from China, the ASEAN states and India. How Western governments will respond remains unclear, in his view. They could view the election as an opportunity to reestablish contact with the junta, which has so far refused any diplomatic mediation. Mathieson calls this a «folly,» pointing to the West’s lack of a clear plan for Myanmar.





The junta is unlikely to collapse anytime soon. It appears to be strong enough to hold off the rebels, at least within its strongholds in the country's interior. Internal divisions are also unlikely to bring it down – outwardly, the junta shows few signs of fracturing, and little is known about its internal dynamics. A prolonged civil war in the heart of Asia appears the more probable outcome.





And even if the junta were to fall, then what? The ethnic armed organizations would likely maintain control over their own territories, Mathieson says, «but violent anarchy would probably break out in Myanmar's interior.»

Violent Extremism in the Sahel,Published date not found (newspaper3k),https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/violent-extremism-sahel,"The persistent and growing strength of violent extremist organizations in the Sahel threatens to exacerbate the humanitarian crisis and spread instability across Africa, posing significant security and financial risks to the United States and Europe. The continuing collapse of international counterterrorism support, as well as weakening leadership in regional efforts, has created a vacuum in which violent extremism can expand. Organizations including Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen (JNIM), Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS), Islamic State in the West African Province (ISWAP), and others have already taken advantage of that vacuum, using countries in the region as platforms to launch indiscriminate attacks on government forces and civilians alike. Other non-state actors, such as the Wagner Group, have also capitalized on the absence of foreign involvement to expand their influence. The possible convergence of security threats, including increased cooperation among terrorist organizations, and between terrorist and criminal organizations, could intensify the danger those groups pose in the region and beyond.

Background

Spanning the area from Senegal to Eritrea, situated between the Sahara to the north and the African tropics to the south, the Sahel region has long faced severe, complex security and humanitarian crises. Since gaining independence in the 1960s, many countries in the Sahel have experienced violent extremism due to the confluence of weak and illegitimate governance, economic decline, and the worsening effects of climate change. Violence, conflict, and crime have surged over the last decade, transcending national borders and posing significant challenges to countries both in and outside the region. The Sahel remains a principal transit point for migrants traveling from sub-Saharan Africa to northern coastal states and on to Europe. Further violence could exponentially increase the rate of displacement and migration from the region, compounding pressures on northern and coastal African states and Europe. The epicenters of violence and humanitarian disaster are in the Liptako-Gourma and Lake Chad Basin subregions.

Liptako-Gourma is in the central Sahel, in the borderlands of Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger. Current instability is associated with the collapse of the Libyan state in 2011, which led to the proliferation of weapons and armed fighters in the region. The influx of extremists into northern Mali reignited the dormant Tuareg rebellion [PDF] in 2012, which had previously surfaced in 1963, 1990, and 2006. Representing only 10 percent of the Malian population, the Tuareg people, organized under the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA), sought an autonomous state and aligned themselves with multiple Islamist groups, including al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), the Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa (MUJAO), and Ansar Dine to push government forces out of the north. Then-President Amadou Toumani Touré was deposed in a March 2012 coup by the army, which disapproved of the government’s failure to suppress the rebellion. The consequent collapse of state institutions in the north enabled the MNLA to capture the regional capitals of Gao, Kidal, and Timbuktu; the group had declared the independent state of Azawad [PDF] in northern Mali by April. The MNLA quickly split from al-Qaeda and other allied Islamist groups in June following their attempt to impose Islamic law and declare an Islamic caliphate over the northern territory.

After a period of relative calm, the crisis deteriorated in January 2013 as AQIM, MUJAO, and Ansar Dine pushed further south to capture Konna in central Mali. In August, Mali transitioned back to a civilian-led government under Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta, which later signed a peace agreement with a coalition of Tuareg independence groups including the MNLA in 2015. The coalition excluded Islamist organizations, which quickly took advantage of the agreement to expand their control, spreading further into central Mali and neighboring Burkina Faso and Niger. Liptako-Gourma has since become a hotbed for violent extremism in the Sahel.

Notable attacks targeting the Radisson Blu Hotel in Mali, the Splendid Hotel in Burkina Faso, and L’Etoule du Sud Hotel in Ivory Coast in 2015 and 2016 demonstrated the extent of the Islamist threat to the Sahel and West Africa. In September 2016, the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS) surfaced in Burkina Faso, launching its first major attack on a border post near the Burkinabe city of Markoye. In 2017, several al-Qaeda affiliates merged to form Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen (JNIM). The emergence of ISGS and JNIM have intensified violence in the Sahel. Both JNIM and ISGS have pushed farther south in Liptako-Gourma, threatening the security of West Africa’s relatively stable coastal states. JNIM has more recently gained control over territory in northern and central Mali, while ISGS has been confined to northern Burkina Faso and western Niger due to clashes with JNIM that began in 2020.

Violent extremism in the Lake Chad Basin at the intersection of Cameroon, Chad, Niger, and Nigeria prevailed in the same period with the reemergence of Boko Haram in northern Nigeria. Founded by Muhammed Yusuf in northeastern Nigeria in 2002, Boko Haram was forced underground in 2009 after Nigerian police forces killed over seven hundred members, including Yusuf, during a raid that July. In June and August 2011, Boko Haram resurfaced, indicating its more expansive and aggressive strategy by launching suicide attacks [PDF] on police and the UN headquarters in Abuja, Nigeria. The group gained international notoriety following its abduction of 276 girls from the town of Chibok, Nigeria, giving rise to the global Bring Back Our Girls movement in April 2014.

In 2015, Boko Haram pledged allegiance to the self-proclaimed Islamic State and rebranded as the Islamic State in the West African Province (ISWAP). A splinter faction of the original Boko Haram was active until 2021, when ISWAP killed its leader, absorbed its territory, and relegated its members to remote islands in Lake Chad. ISWAP has since established control of northeastern Nigeria and parts of Niger.

Experts attribute the expansion of violent extremism in the Sahel to persistently weak governance, characterized by corruption, democratic backsliding, legitimacy deficits, and human rights violations. Many countries in the region share similar internal dynamics of inequality [PDF]—state power tends to be concentrated in southern, urban regions while rural, northern areas remain underdeveloped and ripe for exploitation by extremist groups. Thus, Sahel countries are consistently ranked high on the Fragile State Index, particularly Chad, Mali, and Nigeria. Frequent transfers of power are also a problem: Chad, Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger experienced a combined twenty-five successful coups d’état between 1960 and 2022. Consecutive military coups in Mali in 2020 and 2021, resulting in Mali’s current interim government under a military junta, launched the region’s most recent so-called coup epidemic, which saw similar occurrences in Burkina Faso, Chad, and Niger.

The death of Chadian President Idriss Déby on April 20, 2021, created a leadership crisis in regional counterterrorism efforts. Under Déby, Chad and its military acted as a linchpin in regional security coalitions across both Liptako-Gourma and the Lake Chad Basin. The Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF)—comprised of Benin, Cameroon, Chad, Niger, and Nigeria—was activated in 2014 to respond to the threat of Boko Haram, organized crime, and banditry in the Lake Chad Basin. In February 2017, France and the Group of Five for the Sahel (G5) countries—Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger—announced the creation of the G5 Sahel Force, a five-thousand-troop-strong counterterrorism force aimed at fighting militant groups with an expanded mandate to cross borders in the Sahel region. Increasing civilian casualties and severe human rights violations by security forces in Chad, Mali, and Nigeria have further undermined regional and national efforts.

In 2013, international involvement began in earnest when French forces entered Mali at the request of the Malian government. Operation Serval, later transformed into Operation Barkhane, became a three-thousand-strong force based in N’Djamena, Chad, focused on rooting out violent extremists in Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger, in partnership with local governments and with the support of Chad and Mauritania. In 2015, Operation Barkhane’s mandate expanded to provide additional support to the MNJTF [PDF] in its fight against Boko Haram. Operation Barkhane was quickly succeeded by the establishment of the UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINSUMA) and, in 2020, support from the European Union–led Task Force Takuba. By 2020, France had deployed 5,100 troops supported by 15,000 UN peacekeepers from around the world.

The United States has also provided logistics and advisory support to both the MNJTF and G5 Sahel Force. In addition, the U.S. military has increased its presence in the Sahel, deploying approximately 1,500 troops to the region and building a drone base in Niger as a platform for strikes against groups across West and North Africa. On October 4, 2017, members of the U.S. Special Operations Task Force were ambushed by an Islamic State–affiliate group in Tongo Tongo, Niger, leading to the deaths of four servicemen. The United States also remains a top donor of humanitarian assistance; continues to provide military training, such as the Flintlock program; and has delivered millions of dollars of arms to the region.

Despite increased international involvement, the campaign against militants has instead caused the spread of militancy to countries across the Sahel. That failure, coupled with France’s growing unpopularity in its former colonies, led French President Emmanuel Macron to announce on July 13, 2021, that Operation Barkhane would end in the first quarter of 2022. In February 2022, France and its European allies comprising Task Force Takuba also announced their intent to withdraw all troops from Mali, ending their nearly decade-long intervention.

Violent extremists exploited the resulting security vacuum with heightened attacks across the Sahel. The first six months of 2022 saw a dramatic increase in attacks, particularly in the Liptako-Gourma area and spilling into coastal West Africa. More than two thousand civilians were killed during this period, an over 50 percent increase from 2021. Many attacks have specifically targeted MINUSMA, which has been dubbed the United Nations’ most dangerous peacekeeping mission. In lieu of French support, the Malian military junta sought security assistance from the Wagner Group, a Russian mercenary organization involved in other fragile contexts including the Central African Republic, Libya, Mozambique, Sudan, Syria, and Ukraine. Since its introduction in December 2021, the Wagner Group has deployed one thousand mercenaries to Mali housed at fifteen outposts, including former French bases. March 2022 was the deadliest month recorded by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project since 1997—coinciding with renewed activism by ISGS along the Niger-Mali border and the Moura massacre in central Mali. On March 23, Malian soldiers accompanied by Russian mercenaries from the Wagner Group launched a five-day attack on the town to root out Islamist militants, killing more than three hundred civilians.

Prospects for regional and international counterterrorism efforts deteriorated further in May 2022 when the Malian government officially terminated its Defense Cooperation Treaty with France alongside the Status of Force Agreement formerly governing France and the European Union’s operations in the country. Mali’s military government also pulled out of the G5 Sahel—greatly diminishing the organization’s counterterrorism capacity. In June, JNIM killed 132 villagers in central Mali, the deadliest attack on civilians since the coup.

In June 2023, Mali’s government demanded the departure of MINUSMA, the UN peacekeeping force. The UN agreed to withdraw within six months, raising concerns of a power vacuum and setbacks for Mali’s transition to civilian rule, for which the junta claims a June 2023 referendum was a first step. MINUSMA has also played a key role in assuaging Tuareg separatists, who warn that the UN departure will deal a “fatal blow” to the peace agreement.

An acute humanitarian crisis is exacerbating violent extremism’s threat to regional stability. The last decade of conflict has displaced 2.6 million people in Liptako-Gourma and 2.8 million people in the Lake Chad Basin, with hundreds of thousands of refugees pouring into neighboring countries. Sahel countries consistently rank [PDF] among the world’s poorest with compounding issues [PDF] of poverty, food insecurity, high unemployment, and the world’s fastest-growing population. The Lake Chad Basin crisis has long been recognized as one of the worst humanitarian disasters in the world due to the severe harm of climate change and weak governance in rural areas. Temperatures in the Sahel are rising 1.5 times faster than the global average, directly damaging the livelihoods of millions dependent upon natural resources. Diminishing land and water resources have led to increasingly frequent clashes between herding, farming, and fishing communities. Violent extremist organizations have not only helped worsen humanitarian conditions, including by targeting humanitarian workers, but have also exploited [PDF] insecure conditions to recruit and control populations in the Sahel. In addition, the weakened economies and proliferating violent extremists have increased illicit activity and criminal organizations in the region, further contributing to instability.

Recent Developments

In January 2023, UN experts advocated for an independent investigation into potential war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by government forces and the Wagner Group in Mali. The experts claimed a “climate of terror and complete impunity” characterized the Wagner Group’s activities in the country, pointing to the Moura massacre in March 2022. Wagner’s future in West Africa is less certain after the group’s failed June 2023 rebellion in Russia, but Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia would allow its African operations to continue. In July 2023, the United States accused Wagner Group leader Yevgeny Prigozhin of orchestrating Mali’s decision to expel MINUSMA to advance Wagner’s interests. Neighboring Burkina Faso has denied contracting Wagner Group, but the interim president said Russia is a strategic ally.

In 2023, security forces in Mali and Burkina Faso faced allegations of civilian massacres. First, in April, survivors of a massacre in Burkina Faso blamed the military for the deaths of 136 civilians. Then, in May, the UN released a report accusing Malian soldiers and foreign fighters of executing more than five hundred civilians in a March 2022 operation. Meanwhile, armed groups have stepped up attacks on poorly trained civilian volunteer forces. The withdrawal of the UN from Mali raises the risk of violence against civilians, as extremist groups might attempt to seize urban centers as they have in Burkina Faso.

A July 26 coup d’etat in Niger, the ninth attempted overthrow of a West African government in the last three years, dealt a significant blow to counterterrorism and stabilization efforts in the Sahel. Niger’s government fended off a coup attempt in March 2021, two days before President-elect Mohamed Bazoum assumed office, but the most recent coup attempt succeeded in unseating him. Despite pressure from ECOWAS, including sanctions and the threat of military intervention, the coup leaders have refused to cede power and declared a new government. The military junta have since announced that they will prosecute Bazoum for treason; Bazoum is currently being held in an undisclosed location after a failed escape from his home in Niamey. In response, the African Union suspended Niger, which was the institution's first public communication since it convened immediately following the coup. Nearby military regimes Guinea, Burkina Faso, and Mali have backed junta, with the latter two vowing to treat military intervention in Niger as a “declaration of war.” On September 16, the military leaders of Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger signed a mutual defense pact, solidifying their alliance against external intervention.

Niger had become the West’s last major counterterrorism partner in the Sahel in recent years after a series of coups in neighboring countries, but the takeover threatens to upend its status as a bulwark against an expanding power vacuum. Shortly after seizing power, the coup leaders ceased military cooperation with France, which moved its troops to Niger in 2022 as its relations with Mali deteriorated. On October 22, France completed the withdrawal of its forces from Niger, repatriating troops and equipment via Chad and Cameroon.

In contrast, the United States signaled that it will pursue pragmatic relations with Niger's military junta. This came shortly after the United States officially designated the military takeover a coup, requiring the United States to suspend over $500 million in economic and military aid. The United States still maintains around one thousand troops in the country, and recently resumed drone flights and manned counterterrorism operations from its bases in the country. However, there is increased fear that Russia's Wagner Group is ""taking advantage"" of Niger's instability to expand its regional influence, as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned after the coup.

Meanwhile, extremist violence has surged across the Sahel. The first seven months of 2023 saw at least 7,800 civilian deaths, a significant increase from 2022, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED). This data contradicts claims by the military juntas in Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger that they are effectively tackling insecurity.

Mali is on the brink of civil war as Islamist groups and Tuareg rebels consolidate power in northern Mali. The increase in violence coincides with the withdrawal of UN peacekeepers with attacks more than doubling since they completed the first phase in August. JNIM, in particular, has taken advantage of the withdrawal to launch a renewed offensive, blockading the northern city of Timbuktu and carrying out a series of attacks on military and civilian targets. In parallel, Mali has redeployed its forces to the northeast as clashes intensify with Tuareg rebels comprising the Coordination of Azawad Movements (CMA). The Wagner Group is said to be leading the Malian offensive to overtake the rebel stronghold in Kidal.

Recent violence in Mali has spilled over into neighboring Burkina Faso and Niger. On September 5, seventeen soldiers and thirty-six volunteer fighters were killed in clashes with Islamist militants in northern Burkina Faso. Less than a month later, twenty-nine soldiers were killed in an attack by ISGS in western Niger. Worsening instability has led to increasing democratic backsliding as the military governments in Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger are struggling to regain control in the wake of dissolving international support.",Center For Preventive Action,https://microsites-live-backend.cfr.org/cdn/ff/HK5BSUpchLy3g6F0FwUE1-05EhXooObCdqExMY0WlVM/1677605453/public/2023-02/Mali_05.jpg
War in the Sahel,Published date not found (newspaper3k),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_the_Sahel,"War in West Africa

A war in the Sahel region of West Africa has been ongoing since the 2011 Arab Spring. In particular, the intensive conflict in the three countries of Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso has been referred to as the Sahel War.

The conflict is generally seen to have begun during the early stages of the Mali War, which itself was seen as a spillover conflict of the Insurgency in the Maghreb. As Islamist Tuareg rebels overran Mali in 2012, a concurrent insurgency in Nigeria, led by Boko Haram, began to spread to nearby countries. By 2015, the Mali war had spread to Burkina Faso and Niger, which led to heavy fighting and humanitarian crises in both countries.

The conflict in Nigeria also reached a climax before a 2015 coalition offensive forced insurgents into remission. By 2019, the effects of the region-wide conflict began to accelerate due to resentment within the populace and due to alleged inability to handle the conflict. These views led to a series of coups in Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Sudan, Chad and Guinea, which led to the region being labeled a 'coup belt'.

Background [ edit ]

Since 2007, al-Qaeda in the Maghreb (AQIM) has been engaging the Algerian government in an insurgency campaign in the Maghreb. AQIM fighters are mostly drawn from the Algerian and local Saharan communities (such as the Tuareg and the tribal clans of Mali).[34] After the First Libyan Civil War in 2011, south-western Libya has offered sanctuaries to the AQIM Islamic Jihadists, which dispatched cells to be established in the region.[35]

Mali [ edit ]

Tuareg rebellion and Malian civil war [ edit ]

After the end of the 2011 Libyan Civil War, an influx of weaponry led to the arming of the Tuareg in their demand for greater autonomy and independence of their homeland in northern Mali, which they called Azawad.[36] In Libya, the Tuareg people largely supported Gaddafi during the war, and Tuareg areas such as Ghat remain Gaddafi loyalist strongholds.[37] Tuareg fighters who fought for Gaddafi began to return from Libya after the war ended, citing discrimination from the new government.[38]

In October 2011, the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA) was formed from rebels of previous Tuareg rebellions and fighters who had returned from Libya. Another Tuareg-dominated group, the Islamist Ansar Dine, also fought against the Malian government. However, unlike the MNLA, it does not seek independence but rather the impositions of sharia across united Mali.[39]

In March 2012, Malian President Amadou Toumani Touré was ousted in a coup d'état over his handling of the conflict. Following the coup, Northern Mali's three largest cities, Kidal, Gao and Timbuktu, were overrun by the rebels.[40]

On 6 April 2012, the MNLA said that it had accomplished its goals and proclaimed Azawad to be independent from Mali.[41]

The MNLA were initially backed by Ansar Dine. However, Ansar Dine and other Islamist groups, including Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa (MUJAO), a splinter group of AQIM, began imposing strict Sharia law in conquered territories. They soon came into conflict with the MNLA. By July 2012, the MNLA had lost control of most of northern Mali to the Islamists.[42]

By January 2013, Islamist forces advanced to 600 km from the capital and were closing in to capture the major town of Mopti. The MNLA began peace talks to realign with the Malian government while the French military launched Opération Serval on January 11, intervening in the conflict. A French air campaign helped the Malian government to push back Islamist advances, allowing them to take back the major cities of Timbuktu, Gao and Kidal. By the end of May 2013, Islamist and Tuareg forces had to retreat to the desert of northeastern Mali.

Foreign interventions [ edit ]

Since February 2007 the United States and partner nations in the Saharan and Sahel regions of Africa conduct Operation Juniper Shield, consisting of counterterrorism efforts and policing of arms and drug trafficking across central Africa.

The French Opération Serval ended in July 2014. Operation Barkhane commenced shortly after on 1 August 2014 to ""assure the Sahel nations' security, and in effect France's security"".[43]

In 2022 Russian mercenaries from the Wagner Group were deployed in Mali,[44][45] as well as soldiers from the Russian regular army[citation needed]. At the same time, Turkish intervention had intensified[citation needed].

Insurgency spreading to other countries [ edit ]

Niger [ edit ]

Niger faces jihadist insurgencies both in its western regions (as a result of the spillover of the Mali War) and in its southeastern region (as a result of the spillover of the Islamic insurgency in Nigeria). The insurgency in the west of the country began with incursions in 2015 and intensified from 2017 onwards. Since 2021, attacks were carried out with greater frequency in the country. In 2023 a successful coup was carried out, leading to the creation of a military junta and the start to an international crisis.

Burkina Faso [ edit ]

The insurgency in the Sahel spread to Burkina Faso in 2015, beginning with an attack on a gendarme by alleged Boko Haram members. In 2016, the amount of attacks spiked after a new group, Ansarul Islam was founded by imam Ibrahim Malam Dicko.

Since 2021, the insurgency in Burkina Faso has begun to spread to neighboring countries of Ivory Coast, Ghana, Benin and Togo. On 8 February 2022, insurgents attacked the W National Park in Benin, killing nine people. On 11 May 2022, militants crossed the border into Togo and killed eight soldiers.[46]

2020s [ edit ]

Beginning in the early 2020s, numerous coups were staged in countries in the Sahel, namely the 2020 and 2021 coups in Mali, in Guinea, Chad, Sudan, Burkina Faso and Niger. The coups further complicated the situation in the region.

On 21 January 2025, Niger, Burkina Faso and Mali decided to create a joint armed force of 5,000 soldiers to fight regional jihadism in the Sahel.[47]

Boko Haram and ISWAP insurgency [ edit ]

Having cooperated and trained alongside AQIM in the Sahel since 2006, the Nigerian Islamist group Boko Haram began expanding into Chad and Niger in 2014 after successfully seizing territory in the insurgency in Nigeria.[48] By then controlling a significant area around Lake Chad, a coalition of Western African countries launched an offensive against the group in January 2015.[49] The group eventually ended its alliance with al-Qaeda, pledging allegiance to ISIL in March 2015. By the end of 2015 Boko Haram had been largely pushed to retreat into the Sambisa Forest in Nigeria, although attacks have continued including in Niger.[50][51]

Effects [ edit ]

As a result of the insurgency, the affected countries have been severely destabilized, with the emergence of the coup belt following several coup d'états within the region due to perceived inability to handle the conflict. In Mali and Burkina Faso, both countries lost significant control of their territory to the Islamists. The conflict has also seen a political shift in the region, with many military juntas, many having recently overthrown US- and Chinese-backed governments, allying themselves with the Russian government and the Wagner Group.[389]

In particular, Mali has seen significant activity of the Wagner Group as the government moved closer to Turkey and Russia. Niger saw its government being overthrown in 2023 due to poor management of the conflict. In particular, the M62 Movement, a pro-Russian group, supported the coup. Burkina Faso also saw its government being overthrown twice within a year, with coups occurring in January and September, both of which caused by poor management of the conflict against Islamists. As a result of Russian expansion, Ukraine had funded opposition groups.[389]

Although not affected as much, countries nearby like Ghana, Benin, Guinea, Togo and the Ivory Coast have been under constant threat of either full-on insurgency or severe destabilization internally. Guinea has already seen a coup d'état while the Gambia has seen turmoil internally. Northern Benin has seen an increase in terrorism attributed to Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin and the Islamic State, with 28 incidents attributed to the groups between 1 November 2021 and 14 September 2022, including the W National Park massacre.[390]

The Shifting Front of Militant Islamist Violence in the Sahel – Africa Center,Published date not found (newspaper3k),https://africacenter.org/spotlight/militant-islamist-violence-sahel/,"The Sahel has held the designation of the most lethal theater of militant Islamist violence in Africa for 4 years in a row. The Sahel accounted for 55 percent of all such fatalities, costing the lives of 10,400 people out of a total of 18,900 deaths continentally. An estimated 67 percent of all non-combatants killed by militant Islamist groups in Africa are in the Sahel.

Three Sahelian countries—Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger—are the focal point of militant Islamist violence in the region. This violence has widened in scale and scope in recent years. Fatalities linked to these groups are more than two and half times the levels seen in 2020 when the first military coup in Mali occurred. Subsequent coups in Burkina Faso and Niger have also been followed by deteriorating security. Militant Islamist groups control more territory and transportation arteries in the three countries than at any point since the insurgencies began more than a decade ago. These figures are likely an undercount as the military juntas in all three countries have systematically intimidated journalists for reporting on military setbacks.

The widening security threat in the Sahelian countries is resulting in growing pressure on the neighboring coastal West African countries of Benin, Togo, Ghana, Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea, Senegal, and Mauritania.

Militant Islamist violence in the Sahel is not uniform but marked by concurrent patterns of expansion, plateau, and modest reductions. The divergent trends merit deeper analysis to better understand the focal points, actors, and objectives of the different extremist groups driving this violence.

Multiple Groups, Multiple Agendas

The threat from militant Islamist groups in the Sahel is multidimensional with distinct groups each operating with their own unique leadership, organizational structure, objectives, fundraising, recruitment, and tactics. In 2017, several of these militant groups with affiliations to al Qaeda joined a coalition called Jama’at Nusrat al Islam wal Muslimeen (JNIM) to coordinate their activities and shield the composite entities from scrutiny.

JNIM’s most active group is the Maçina Liberation Front (FLM) led by the charismatic Fulani preacher Amadou Koufa. As it has consolidated its grip on territory around its stronghold in central Mali, the FLM has used this base as a launching pad to expand into southern Mali and Burkina Faso. This includes a high-profile attack on a gendarmerie base in the capital city of Bamako in September 2024, in which dozens of soldiers were killed and the presidential plane set on fire.

Other JNIM contingents, like Ansaroul Islam and Katiba Hanifa, have sustained their activities in northern and eastern Burkina Faso, consolidating their positions there and expanding further south into the border areas of Togo and Benin.

Militant Islamist groups first gained a foothold in the Sahel in northern Mali two decades ago with the emergence of fighters from al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), who had been operating in Algeria. Building on this growing influence, a Tuareg leader from Kidal, Iyad ag Aghali, founded Ansar Dine in 2011. Ansar Dine subsequently became a founding member of JNIM, with ag Ghali recognized as its official emir.

Another AQIM offshoot led by Abu al Bara al Sahrawi rebranded itself as the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS) in 2015, pledging allegiance to the Islamic State. Building on its de facto territorial control in the northern Malian region of Ménaka (which was consolidated after the withdrawal of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) in December 2023), ISGS has increased its violent attacks in western Niger where fatalities have jumped 66 percent (to 1,318 deaths) over the last year. ISGS militants have also maintained their pressure around the northern Malian city of Gao and the Oudalan and Séno Provinces of northern Burkina Faso where they have at times clashed with JNIM-affiliated militants. The concentration of ISGS activities in this area suggests a carving out of territory by ISGS from JNIM, with ISGS operating as the main actor in Ménaka and western Niger.

Sifting through these competing actors and areas of influence, three broad patterns of militant Islamist violence in the Sahel emerge:

Zones of rising militant Islamist group violence

Zones of militant Islamist group entrenchment

Threats to the border areas of coastal West African countries

Click for printable high-resolution PDF.

Zones of Rising Militant Islamist Violence

Zones of rising militant Islamist violence account for 42 percent of the fatalities observed in the Sahel over the past year. Three distinct areas stand out.

Central Mali and Boucle du Mouhoun, Burkina Faso [ See ● dots on Zone Map ]

FLM remains most deeply entrenched in Central Mali and the neighboring region of Boucle du Mouhoun in northwest Burkina Faso. FLM has mobilized recruitment by exploiting economic and political tensions between pastoralist and farming communities in central Mali. FLM targets Fulani youth by presenting itself as sympathetic to the pastoralists’ grievances.

As FLM militants have pushed into Burkina Faso, they have engaged in livestock theft, the burning of villages, and destruction of bridges, further impoverishing and displacing communities that have resisted their presence. This is part of a trend in which the FLM has established itself through violence and, in the process, gained control of greater swathes of territory, transportation arteries, and economic activity.

The central Malian regions of Segou and Mopti saw more violent events (605) and fatalities (1,557) than in any previous year.

The 38-percent increase in fatalities registered in the Boucle du Mouhoun Region of Burkina Faso (resulting in 1,199 deaths) reflected the largest year-on-year increase of any region in the country. In the year prior to Burkina Faso’s two military coups in 2022, Boucle du Mouhoun reported 58 fatalities.

Considering Boucle du Mouhoun, Mopti, and Segou, there has been a 165-percent increase in fatalities (from 1,038 to 2,756) linked to militant Islamist groups from 2021 to 2024.

Roughly 1 out of every 3 fatalities linked to militant Islamist groups in Mali and Burkina Faso took place in either Boucle du Mouhoun, Mopti, or Segou in 2024.

As FLM expands southward from Central Mali and Boucle du Mouhoun into southwest Burkina Faso, it poses a growing threat to Bobo Dioulasso—Burkina Faso’s second largest city (with a population of 1.2 million) and economic hub in the subregion. Taking territory surrounding Bobo Dioulasso would enable FLM to link up its core contingent of forces with FLM-affiliated fighters already established in Burkina Faso’s southwest near the border with Côte d’Ivoire. This would also place FLM in a position to push westward toward Bamako and the border with Guinea.

Vanguard FLM Force on the Ivorian Border [See ● dots in southwestern Burkina Faso on Zone Map] An offshoot group of FLM-linked militants has entrenched itself around the Dida Forest in southwestern Burkina Faso’s Cascades Region since 2019. These militants have struggled to establish a foothold in northern Côte d’Ivoire, but they have tapped into smuggling and trafficking networks as well as artisanal mining sites in the area. Led by a commander using the nom de guerre “Hamza,” this militant Islamist group has recruited from marginalized populations, intermixed with criminal actors, and established ongoing revenue streams that have made the violent extremists more self-reliant.

FLM is also using its base in central Mali and Boucle du Mouhoun to stage more attacks into southern Mali. FLM’s expansion into this region represents an alarming development given that 60 percent of Malian citizens reside in southern Mali. The region is also the agricultural heart of the country, where cotton cultivation provides livelihoods for over 4 million people, roughly 20 percent of the population. Southern Mali is also the area in which most industrial scale mining occurs, making it strategically important to the country’s economy. Gold dominates Mali’s mining sector, representing more than 90 percent of the country’s mineral production. Deposits of diamonds, rock salt, phosphates, semi-precious stones, bauxite, iron ore, and manganese are also mined in this region. Taken together, Mali’s top two exports, gold and cotton, make up around 80 percent of export earnings in Mali’s economy. The deteriorating security situation in southern Mali, therefore, portends mounting disruptions for the country.

Bamako suffered a major attack in September 2024 when FLM forces hit a gendarmerie school, resulting in the loss of dozens of soldiers. The past year saw nearly triple the number of violent events occurring within 150 km of Bamako compared to 4 years ago.

No other zone in the Sahel recorded a sharper increase in militant Islamist group activity than southern Mali in the past year, with fatalities linked to violent events jumping by 87 percent (from 168 to 314).

The geographically strategic location of western Niger—abutting both central Mali and eastern Burkina Faso—makes it a highly influential zone of control for militant Islamist groups. Since the July 2023 military coup in Niamey, violent events and associated fatalities have dramatically increased in this zone as both JNIM and ISGS carve out their areas of influence in Niger.

JNIM affiliates Ansaroul Islam and Katiba Hanifa have targeted the commercial corridors facilitating trade between Ouagadougou and Niamey. Building on its base in Mali’s Ménaka Region, ISGS has also rapidly expanded its control of territory in western Niger since the coup. ISGS has mounted increasingly lethal attacks in the Tillaberi Region. This has enabled ISGS to severely disrupt northbound transportation between Niamey and Gao in Mali.

ISGS and Ansaroul Islam are both also targeting different sections of the primary westbound artery from Niamey to Djibo in Burkina Faso. Meanwhile, a recently emerged shadowy JNIM group referred to as Katiba Hanifa disrupts a major commercial transit route that connects Niamey to Ouagadougou through the eastern city of Fada N’Gourma. These developments present a growing security and economic threat to Niamey as it finds itself increasingly encircled by the two extremist factions.

ISGS has also entrenched itself in areas of northern Burkina Faso in Oudalan and Seno Provinces where the borders of Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger meet. The collective effect of these escalations is a steadily deteriorating security situation in western Niger.

Fatalities linked to militant Islamist violence in western Niger have increased 66 percent from 793 in 2023 to 1,318 in 2024. These fatalities represent a marked increase in lethality as the number of violent events increased only marginally from 230 to 243 over the same period.

Niger’s Tillaberi Region, which borders both Burkina Faso and Mali, recorded 92 percent of the fatalities (1,212) linked to militant Islamist groups (primarily ISGS and Ansaroul Islam ) in western Niger in 2024.

) in western Niger in 2024. Long focused on Ménaka in northern Mali, ISGS is now linked to roughly the same number of violent events in western Niger (145) as in northern Mali (149). By stretching its influence southward both west and east of Niamey, ISGS militants may be seeking to encircle the Nigerien capital while also gaining control over supply routes to northwest Nigeria.

JNIM (likely Ansaroul Islam), meanwhile, has been expanding its violent activity in western and southwestern Niger. It was linked to 598 fatalities in 2024, a 237-percent increase over the previous year.

Roughly 90 percent of these JNIM-linked attacks in western Niger were concentrated in two areas: the region bordering eastern Burkina Faso and the border areas of northern Benin. The latter attacks are likely linked to Katiba Hanifa.

Areas of Militant Islamist Group Entrenchment—Northern Mali and Northern Burkina Faso [ See ● dots on Zone Map ]

Several regions of the Sahel saw either plateauing figures of militant Islamist group violence or modest abatements. For example, northern Mali and northern Burkina Faso, excluding Boucle du Mouhoun, saw slight declines in the number of violent events and fatalities from the record levels of violence experienced in 2023. Rather than an improving security situation, however, these plateaus appear to reflect the entrenchment of control over these northern territories where JNIM (likely Ansar Dine and Ansaroul Islam) and ISGS have long maintained a presence. These zones of entrenchment account for 48 percent of the fatalities in the Sahel, underscoring the sustainment of a high degree of militant Islamist violent activity.

In northern Mali, where Ansar Dine has been operating for two decades, militants closely linked to Iyad ag Aghali are able to control main thoroughfares and road arteries. Deadly attacks are so common that civilians are forced to rely on military escort, though these convoys are routinely ambushed by militants. The sparsely populated countryside and challenging terrain offer safe haven to the militants who have besieged dozens of urban centers.

In northern Burkina Faso, JNIM-affiliated Ansaroul Islam led by Jafar Dicko has entrenched itself around the city of Djibo. This area of Burkina Faso, comprising the Nord, Sahel, and Centre-Nord Regions, suffered more than 25 percent (2,674) of all fatalities in the Sahel theatre.

Northern Burkina Faso has also seen multiple incidents in which militants have killed hundreds of civilians and soldiers in single attacks over the past year. In June 2024, likely Ansaroul Islam militants killed more than 100 soldiers in an attack on a military base in Mansila in the Sahel Region of northeastern Burkina Faso. In Centre-Nord Region, militants attacked Barsalogho residents who were digging defensive trenches under the supervision of soldiers and Volunteers for the Defense of the Homeland (VDP) militiamen. Some 400 civilians were believed to be killed in this August 2024 attack. In the same month, suspected Ansaroul Islam militants ambushed a food supply convoy under security force escort in Est Region and killed roughly 150 soldiers and allied militiamen as well as dozens of civilians. These events are among the worst single-day fatality events ever recorded in Burkina Faso’s history.

From its base in northern Burkina Faso, Ansaroul Islam has been able to expand south and east, linking up with Katiba Hanifa in southeastern Burkina Faso while also placing growing pressure on Ouagadougou.

In the tri-border zone between Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger contested by Ansaroul Islam and ISGS, civilians and security forces have come under persistent attack. Attacks on Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) health workers have led the humanitarian organization to suspend its activities in multiple locations in this region including Djibo in northern Burkina Faso and Ménaka in northern Mali. In Ménaka, ISGS has effectively besieged several municipalities to assert its de facto control over the territory. This has resulted in a 28-percent increase in the number of displaced persons in the region and an 85-percent increase in the number of refugees fleeing Ménaka for Niger over the last year.

Blockades by ISGS, FLM, Ansaroul Islam, and Ansar Dine around Kidal and Timbuktu have pushed regions of northern Mali and northern Burkina Faso into emergency levels of food insecurity, causing millions to suffer acute hunger. Throughout the region, dozens of municipalities remain under siege, making it difficult for food and other necessities to reach a growing population of forcibly displaced persons.

In short, even in parts of the Sahel where the recorded events of violence have plateaued or decreased in aggregate, high levels of instability persist.

Threats to Coastal West Africa [ See ● dots on Zone Map ]

The continued expansion of militant Islamist violence in Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger has resulted in an increased number of attacks along and beyond the borders of coastal West African countries, from Mauritania to Nigeria. Most attention has focused on Benin and Togo, which have respectively suffered 153 and 96 militant Islamist group-linked fatalities in 2024. However, there have also been dozens of violent extremist attacks in southern Mali within 50 km of the borders of Mauritania, Senegal, and Guinea. Until recently, these border zones reported little to no activity.

Fatalities linked to militant Islamist group violence within 50 km of or over the borders of coastal West Africa increased 27 percent from 1,601 to 2,036 between 2023 and 2024. This is even though violent events in the same zone dropped slightly from 455 to 449 over the same period.

The most notable increase occurred in Mali, where the number of fatalities linked to militant Islamist groups within 50 km of the border with Mauritania, Senegal, and Guinea shot up from 23 in 2023 to 125 in 2024.

Meanwhile in southwestern Burkina Faso, JNIM-affiliated militants sustained their threat on the border of northern Côte d’Ivoire. Fatalities linked to these groups increased 27 percent from 267 to 361 in 2024.

Pressure on coastal West African countries has been particularly pronounced in the borderlands and jointly protected areas like the WAP parklands, which includes territory from Benin, Burkina Faso, and Niger and is near Togo, Ghana, and Nigeria. The parks’ transboundary location amplifies the complexity this security challenge poses for regional cooperation.

JNIM-affiliate Katiba Hanifa has established itself in southeastern Burkina Faso since 2018. The militants use safe havens in the WAP parklands to infiltrate Benin and Togo while simultaneously expanding west in Burkina Faso along the border with Togo and Ghana.

Katiba Hanifa targets some of the major commercial transit corridors for the region, seeking to exploit and cut off trade flow from coastal ports in Cotonou and Lomé. In 2024, militants heavily targeted both road networks and key border crossings, like Gaya in Niger. This poses a serious threat to Niamey. The Cotonou corridor handles more than 50 percent of Niger’s trade, with an additional 20 percent of Niger’s imports passing through Burkina Faso along routes that Katiba Hanifa has similarly targeted.

In addition to disrupting trade and tapping into the adjacent smuggling and trafficking networks, the militant Islamists have sought to exploit artisanal gold mining sites around the W-Arly-Pendari (WAP) reserve. The parklands are also an important area for pastoralists moving their herds to markets in coastal West Africa or seeking pasture on which to graze their livestock. Katiba Hanifa militants regularly extort livestock herders who move through and around the parklands, adding another important revenue stream to their activities.

As Katiba Hanifa expands westward from its base in southeast Burkina Faso it poses a growing threat to the northern borders of Ghana. Should Katiba Hanifa be able to expand westward across southern Burkina Faso, JNIM-affiliated militants would effectively surround Ouagadougou.

Fatalities linked to militant Islamist groups (likely Katiba Hanifa) in Burkina Faso’s Est Region—which includes the WAP complex and borders Niger, Benin, and Togo—nearly tripled in the last 2 years to 1,472 deaths.

In the Centre-Est Region of Burkina Faso, bordering Togo and Ghana, there was a 266-percent increase in fatalities (to 612 deaths) in the same time span.

The continued southward and westward push of militant Islamist groups is heightening the pressure on the borders of all the coastal West African countries. This will require the redoubling of proactive security and governance outreach measures in the northern regions of these countries to mitigate this threat and hold the line.",The Africa Center For Strategic Studies,https://africacenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mohamed-Amadou-Koufa-3x2-1.jpg

West Africa and the Sahel

Expected Council Action

In April, the Security Council will hold a briefing on West Africa and the Sahel. The Special Representative and Head of the UN Office for West Africa and the Sahel (UNOWAS), Leonardo Santos Simão, is expected to brief.

Key Recent Developments

On 29 January, Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger formally withdrew from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), concluding a year-long process following their announcement in 2024 of their intention to leave the sub-regional bloc. The three countries, led by military juntas that seized power through coups d’état, established the l’Alliance des États du Sahel (Alliance of Sahel States, or AES) in September 2023 as an organisation of collective defence. In March, the AES countries announced their withdrawal from Organization Internationale de la Francophonie (International Organisation of Francophonie), an organisation that promotes the French language and fosters cooperation among French-speaking nations.

In a communiqué adopted at the conclusion of its 66th Ordinary Session in Abuja in December 2024, the ECOWAS Authority of Heads of State and Government established a transitional period until 29 July, during which the three countries could rejoin the bloc. Moreover, it directed the Council of Ministers to convene an Extraordinary Session in the second quarter of 2025 to determine the modalities of separation and to develop a contingency plan outlining the future political and economic relations between ECOWAS and the AES states.

The rise of terrorism and violent extremism continues to undermine security and stability in the Sahel. The region remains a hotspot for extremist groups, including al-Qaida affiliates and factions linked to the Islamic State and the Levant, which exploit weak governance, intercommunal tensions, and economic hardships to expand their influence and destabilise local communities. According to the 2025 Global Terrorism Index (GTI), published by the Institute for Economics and Peace, the Sahel accounted for 19 percent of all terrorist attacks worldwide and 51 percent of global terrorism-related deaths in 2024, up from 48 percent in 2023. Five of the ten countries most affected by terrorism are in the Sahel.

On 21 March, Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS) militants attacked the Fambita Mosque in southwestern Niger, killing at least 44 people and setting fire to a market and several homes. Council members condemned the attack in a 27 March press statement.

Beyond the Sahel, terrorist activity is increasing in coastal West Africa, with Benin and Togo witnessing an increase in attacks. Togo recorded ten attacks resulting in 52 deaths in 2024, with Jama’at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin (JNIM) claiming responsibility for four of these attacks, which accounted for 41 fatalities—up from 12 in 2023. The group also claimed responsibility for three attacks in Benin last year. In early January, terrorist attacks claimed by JNIM in northern Benin, near its border with Burkina Faso and Niger, resulted in the deaths of 28 Beninese soldiers. The attacks were strongly condemned by Council members in a 24 January press statement.

Several countries in West Africa are undergoing political transitions and preparing for key elections in 2025. In Guinea, the military junta led by Colonel Mamady Doumbouya, which seized power in a 2021 coup, agreed with ECOWAS on a ten-point roadmap for civilian rule and elections by late 2024. However, delays, lack of transparency, and insufficient funding have hindered progress. The junta’s announcement of a constitutional referendum in the first half of 2025 has raised tensions, with the opposition accusing the junta of undermining the transition and escalating crackdowns on dissent.

On 26 March, Niger’s military leader General Abdourahamane Tchiani, who seized power in a coup d’état in July 2023, was sworn in as president for a five-year transition period under a new charter that replaces the country’s constitution. He was also promoted to the country’s highest military rank of an army general and signed a decree dissolving all political parties. The new charter reportedly states that the five-year transition period is “flexible” and may be adjusted based on the country’s security situation.

Côte d’Ivoire is set to hold presidential elections on 25 October. President Alassane Ouattara is currently serving a third term, which the opposition claims violates the constitution’s two-term limit. Tensions escalated on 17 March when the electoral commission released the provisional voter list, excluding former President Laurent Gbagbo, former Prime Minister Guillaume Soro, and former Minister Charles Blé Goudé. Their disqualification, reportedly due to past criminal convictions, has sparked accusations of political exclusion, with opposition figures expected to challenge the decision.

In Togo, constitutional amendments introduced in 2024 are set to take effect on 6 May, transitioning the country from a presidential to a parliamentary system and consolidating executive authority under President Faure Gnassingbé, who will assume the new executive position of “President of the Council of Ministers”. These changes, which allow him to extend his rule indefinitely as long as his party maintains parliamentary control, have sparked controversy. Gnassingbé has been in power since 2005, following the death of his father, President Gnassingbé Eyadéma.

Guinea-Bissau’s presidential and legislative elections are scheduled for 30 November; however, the country has been embroiled in political turmoil. President Umaro Sissoco Embaló dissolved parliament in December 2023 following an alleged coup attempt and postponed elections originally planned for 2024. While the opposition contends that Embaló’s term ended on 27 February, the Supreme Court ruled that it extends until 4 September, the date it validated his victory in 2020. ECOWAS’ efforts to mediate have faltered, with a joint ECOWAS-UNOWAS diplomatic mission, deployed from 21 to 28 February, forced to leave on 1 March after Embaló threatened its expulsion, rejecting regional interference. The opposition’s boycott of the joint mission, citing bias, further hindered mediation.

Key Issues and Options

The rise of terrorism in West Africa and the Sahel region—particularly in the AES countries, which have been the epicentre of intensified terrorist attacks in the region—is a major concern for Council members. Over the years, terrorist groups have become more aggressive, leveraging increasingly sophisticated weaponry, including drones. The terrorist threat has progressively spread southward toward coastal states, raising alarm about potential spillover into previously unaffected regions. The growing link between terrorism and maritime crime is also a challenge that threatens to further destabilise the region.

Another significant issue for Council members is how to support the regional counter-terrorism security mechanisms—such as the Accra Initiative and the Multinational Joint Task Force in the Lake Chad basin—in countering this threat. These mechanisms grapple with formidable challenges, including political instability, fragmented security coordination, and persistent funding deficits. Compounding these difficulties has been the withdrawal of Western military assistance, coupled with a shift toward alternative security partnerships—most notably with Russia.

Council members have also been concerned about the resurgence of unconstitutional changes of government, and they continue to closely follow ongoing political transitions in Burkina Faso, Guinea, Mali, and Niger. In this connection, addressing structural conflict drivers in the Sahel, such as poor governance, under-development, and climate change, remains a major issue.

One option for the Council would be to request a briefing from the Secretary-General on possible avenues for enhancing security and governance in the Sahel region. He could brief Council members on the outcome of the assessment by the Independent High-level Panel on Security, Governance and Development in the Sahel (that is, the Issoufou Panel). The Panel was jointly launched by the UN, the African Union, ECOWAS, and the Group of Five for the Sahel Joint Force (FC-G5S) in September 2022 under the leadership of the former president of Niger, Mahamadou Issoufou, to undertake a strategic assessment of “the underlying challenges in the Sahel, including the surge in violent extremism, growing fragility of the economies of the region due to the impact of climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as complex political transitions”. The Panel’s report was discussed at the 8th UN-AU annual conference in October 2024, but Council members have not had the opportunity to be briefed about the report.

Council members may further consider organising an informal briefing to examine the inter-linkages between terrorism and maritime crime in the region, along with their implications for regional peace and security. The briefing could also address the growing use of sophisticated technology by terrorist groups in the region. The Council could also be briefed on security threats posed by climate change and the role of youth in addressing key regional challenges, including conflict, environmental changes, and political instability. This would offer an opportunity for Council members to gain a deeper understanding of these issues and explore potential strategies for addressing them effectively.

The humanitarian crisis in the Sahel and Lake Chad Basin, along with human rights violations by state and non-state actors, are also a major concern. Additionally, several Council members are troubled by ongoing restrictions on civic space and other human rights abuses. Council members could use the briefing as an opportunity to underscore the need for countries in the region to uphold international humanitarian and human rights law.

Council Dynamics

There is broad concern in the Council about the threat of terrorism and the dire humanitarian crises affecting West Africa and the Sahel. However, Council discussion on this region has been increasingly divisive in recent years. The US and European members are worried about Russia’s growing influence in the region and its ties with the military juntas. While Russia supports the views of the AES countries in the Council, several members are concerned about developments in these countries. Sierra Leone, a West African country, and several other members believe it is important for the Council to maintain attention on the region, including how it might support regional efforts to combat the threat of terrorism and violent extremism.

A significant trend shaping regional dynamics in the Sahel is the growing political divide between Sahelian countries and Western powers, coupled with increasing reliance on non-traditional military partnerships, including mercenary groups like the Africa Corps (formerly Wagner Group), to combat insurgencies and consolidate power. In late 2024, Côte d’Ivoire and Senegal requested the withdrawal of French military forces from their respective territories, reflecting a pivotal shift in a region where France has long maintained a military presence.

The wars in Ukraine and Syria have also had implications for the Sahel. In 2024, reports surfaced that Ukraine’s intelligence agency played a role in an ambush targeting Malian forces and Russia’s Wagner Group, resulting in heavy casualties. Ukrainian intelligence later acknowledged its involvement. The attack reportedly involved Tuareg rebels and JNIM militants. In response, the AES countries severed diplomatic ties with Ukraine. In August 2024, Ukraine’s incursion into Russia’s Kursk region reportedly prompted Russia to recall around 100 paramilitary personnel from Burkina Faso to reinforce its domestic defences.

The collapse of Assad’s government in Syria in December 2024 disrupted Russia’s logistical operations, as it had relied on Syrian military bases as a key hub for its activities in Africa. In response, Russia shifted military assets from Syria to other regions, including eastern Libya. At the same time, it strengthened its military partnership with Mali’s junta, delivering over 100 military assets earlier this year, including armoured vehicles, tanks, and weapon systems, reinforcing its influence in the Sahel.

Denmark and Sierra Leone are co-penholders on UNOWAS.

Africa's Sahel: The region with more 'terror deaths' than rest of world combined,Published date not found (newspaper3k),https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8vyl3j5kko,"The region with more 'terror deaths' than rest of world combined

The Sahel region of Africa is the ""epicentre of global terrorism"" and now, for the first time, accounts for ""over half of all terrorism-related deaths"", according to the Global Terrorism Index (GTI). Its new report says that in this semi-arid area to the south of the Sahara Desert 3,885 people out of a worldwide total of 7,555 died. The GTI report adds that while the global figure has declined from a peak of 11,000 in 2015 the figure for the Sahel has increased nearly tenfold since 2019, as extremist and insurgent groups ""continue to shift their focus"" towards the region. The index is published by the Institute for Economics and Peace, a think-tank dedicated to researching global peace and conflict. It defines terrorism as the ""threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non-state actor to attain a political, economic, religious, or social goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation"".

The Sahel stretches from the west coast of Africa eastwards across the continent. The GTI's definition of the region includes parts of 10 countries: Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, Cameroon, Guinea, The Gambia, Senegal, Nigeria, Chad and Mauritania. The Sahel has some of the world's highest birth rates, and almost two-thirds of the population is under 25. Unlike in the West where ""lone actor terrorism is on the rise"", the Sahel, has seen the rapid expansion of militant jihadist groups, according to the report. It says most of the attacks there were carried out by two organisations: the Islamic State group affiliate in the Sahel and Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen (JNIM) - a branch of al-Qaeda. ""They're trying to introduce new legal orders,"" explains Niagalé Bagayoko, chair of the African Security Sector Network. ""They're trying to administer justice in particular based on Sharia."" And in the process, she says they ""are competing with one another"" for land and influence.

IS-Sahel has reportedly doubled the amount of territory it controls in Mali since the country's coups of 2020 and 2021 - largely in the east near its borders with Burkina Faso and Niger - while JNIM also continued to expand its reach, according to a UN panel of experts on Mali. The GTI report notes that both groups have recruited more fighters, including child soldiers in the case of IS. ""In some instances, people tend to be in a point of choicelessness by the time they decide to join a militant group,"" says Beverly Ochieng, a senior analyst specialising in Francophone Africa at Control Risks, a geopolitical risk consultancy. ""These are communities that are very vulnerable."" The GTI report explains how political instability and weak governance are creating ideal conditions for insurgent groups to grow, pointing to conflict as ""the primary driver of terrorism"". The Sahel is sometimes referred to as the ""coup belt"" of Africa. Since 2020 there have been six successful coups in the region as defined by the GTI report: two in Mali, two in Burkina Faso, one in Guinea and one in Niger. These countries are now all run by military juntas. PODCAST: The Sahel’s coup contagion ""The Sahel has experienced a breakdown in state society,"" says Dr Folahanmi Aina, an expert on the region at SOAS University in London. ""It's been informed by years of neglect from political leaders who haven't necessarily prioritised people-centred governance and local grievances have festered, resulting in terror groups trying to leverage these.""

There was a perception that civilian governments were unable to combat security threats from insurgent groups, ""but despite these juntas taking over, they haven't necessarily improved optics on the ground and in fact insecurity has worsened,"" says Dr Aina. ""The juntas are professionally unprepared for the rigours of governance."" In fact in 2024, Burkina Faso ""remained the country most affected by terrorism for the second year in a row"" according to the GTI. In the 14 years since the report began, it is the only country to top the list that is not Iraq or Afghanistan. Jihadist groups sustain their operations in the Sahel with a range of illicit economic activities, including kidnap for ransom and cattle rustling, according to the GTI report. The region has also become a key route for drug traffickers bringing cocaine from South America to Europe, and the report notes that ""drug trafficking represents one of the most financially lucrative illicit activities linked to terrorism in the Sahel"". It points out that that some groups veer away from directly engaging in organised crime, however, preferring to ""make money by imposing taxes or providing security and protection in exchange for payment"". It goes on to explain: ""This model not only generates revenue but also helps these groups integrate into local communities, strengthening their influence."" Insurgent groups are also vying for control of the Sahel's rich natural resources. Niger is the world's seventh-largest producer of uranium, and unregulated artisanal gold mines found throughout the region are often taken advantage of by the likes of IS-Sahel and JNIM.

Following the recent wave of coups, Sahel governments have pivoted away from Western allies, such as France and the US, towards China and Russia for support in tackling militants. ""Right now we're seeing that Russia is taking more assertive control over Russian paramilitaries in the region known as the Africa Corps [formerly Wagner],"" says Ms Ochieng. ""Their work is to train and support the local armies to be able to counter the insurgency in the region, but so far it hasn't been effective."" As a result, the GTI report warns that there is now a risk of overspill beyond the so-called ""epicentre of terror"" to neighbouring countries. In fact, it says this may already be happening - Togo recorded 10 attacks and 52 deaths in 2024, the most since the index began. These were largely concentrated along the country's border with Burkina Faso. Ms Ochieng agrees with this assessment, saying that ""the expansion of militant groups within the region in countries like Benin or Togo or other coastal West African states seems to be imminent"".

G5 Sahel,Published date not found (newspaper3k),https://www.interpol.int/es/Delitos/Terrorismo/Proyectos-de-lucha-contra-el-terrorismo/G5-Sahel,"The aim of this project is to promote the effective use of INTERPOL policing capabilities in the member countries of the Sahel region to combat terrorism.

A Joint Response

The Group of Five for the Sahel (G5 Sahel) was founded in 2014 as a regional, intergovernmental organization. It provides an institutional framework to promote development and security within its five member countries: Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger.

The Sahel region has experienced a devastating surge in terrorist attacks against civilian and military targets. Terrorist groups are present across borders and repeatedly target communities and national institutions through coordinated attacks, taking advantage of porous and extensive borders.

It is essential to identify terrorists, their movements and means of action, in order to prevent and disrupt their activities.

As part of its security mandate, the G5 Sahel created the Joint Task Force in 2017 to strengthen the fight against threats to peace and security and bolster development. Its main objectives are to collect, process, exploit and share relevant criminal information among a diverse range of actors in a complex environment.

It is structured around Military and Police Components, which are connected through the national and regional Security Cooperation Platforms (PCMS, in French “Plateformes de Cooperation en Matière de Sécurité”).

The Project: Integration for Impact

INTERPOL supports the Police Component of the G5 Sahel Joint Task Force (FC-G5S PC) through a three-year project (2019-2022), implemented under the umbrella of the Regional Counter-Terrorism Node for West and Central Africa (RCTN WCAF) initiative, and funded by the German Government.

The main purpose of the project is to ensure effective use of INTERPOL policing capabilities in the member countries of the Sahel region by the FC-G5S PC, along with INTERPOL National Central Bureaus (NCBs) and relevant specialized units and border agencies. This will help increase the exchange of police information and intelligence in the region.

INTERPOL’s support is built around three strategic objectives:

Ensuring military to law enforcement information exchange (Mi-LEx) Bringing battlefield information to frontline officers who can crosscheck it against INTERPOL databases, and share it with the global law enforcement community through the PCMS and INTERPOL’s network of NCBs.

Bringing battlefield information to frontline officers who can crosscheck it against INTERPOL databases, and share it with the global law enforcement community through the PCMS and INTERPOL’s network of NCBs. Providing specialized assistance to relevant units of the Joint Task Force and NCBs Biometric data (Project FIRST) – sharing facial images and digital data on foreign terrorist fighters and other individuals linked to terrorism; Chemicals and explosives (Project WATCHMAKER) – increasing knowledge on known or suspected entities involved in the unlawful use of chemicals, explosive materials and improvised explosive devices; Data processing and Criminal Analysis – developing an intelligence model and setting up a cross-country network of analysts.

Connecting and maintaining INTERPOL I-24/7 access – in the field and at strategic ports of entry in all G5 Sahel countries to ensure access to INTERPOL databases for frontline officers.

Member countries retain control over their data at all times, and define which other countries can access it.

INTERPOL’s unique role

INTERPOL facilitates exchanges between its 196 member countries to compile and compare information and identifiers of suspected foreign fighters.

This goal is enshrined in numerous Security Council resolutions, in particular UNSCR 2178 (2014) and UNSCR 2396 (2017), as well as the G7 Ministers of Interior Joint Communiques in 2017, 2018 and 2019, and the Counter-ISIS Coalition Guiding Principles 2018.

In addition, ongoing cooperation with military operations in the Middle East (e.g. Counter-ISIS Coalition Forces) to share battlefield information via INTERPOL channels means the Organization is uniquely placed to provide insight, expertise and support, as connections develop between the Military and Police Components of the G5 Sahel Joint Task Force.",,https://www.interpol.int/var/interpol/storage/images/0/4/9/0/210940-1-eng-GB/5be9520e1b71-Preview-G5-Sahel.jpg
Military Operations Command,Published date not found (newspaper3k),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Operations_Command,"Syrian opposition military coalition

The Military Operations Command, or the Military Operations Department,[a][4] formerly known as Al-Fatah al-Mubin until November 2024,[b] is a joint military operations room of Islamist and nationalist factions of the Syrian opposition participating in the Syrian civil war. The operations room was declared in June 2019, evolving from the ""Damascus Conquest"" operations room formed in May,[5] during the Syrian Army's Dawn of Idlib 1 campaign,[6] and consists of rebel groups operating in opposition-held areas of northwestern Syria concentrated in Idlib.[7]

The three groups comprising the coalition are Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the Turkish-backed National Front for Liberation, and Jaysh al-Izza.[8] In October 2020, HTS and two leading factions from the NLF began to finalize the creation of a Unified Military Council in Idlib.[9][10]

In December 2024, the alliance launched an offensive which resulted in the collapse of the Assad-led government and a new transitional government led by senior figures from Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham. The new Minister of Defense, Murhaf Abu Qasra, announced that all rebel factions will be dissolved and merged into the Ministry of Defense.[11]

History [ edit ]

The rebel factions in Idlib declared the start of the ""Great Conquest"" operation on 7 June 2019 during the Syrian Army's Idlib offensive, as the second phase of a rebel counterattack that had begun a day prior. The first operation, ""Defeating the aggression."" had resulted in the rebels seizing several towns and positions.[12]

First northwestern Syria offensive [ edit ]

Pro-rebel sources reported the factions hit a RuAF SU-22.[13] On 8 June, al-Fateh al-Mubin operations room advanced into several areas north of Hama and cut the road between the town of Maharda and Skaylbia.[14] A faction in the coalition also reportedly damaged a SyAAF Aero L-39 Albatros, forcing it to land.[13]

On 16 June, the Syrian Observatory on Human Rights (SOHR), a UK-based monitor, reported that the factions repulsed an attack on their positions at the Tal Meleh axis.[15]

On 18 June, the operations room carried out an attack on the Tal Meleh axis. Syrian state media reporting they halted the attack.[16] The Syrian Army, in turn, declared the start of an operation to recapture the towns of Tal Meleh and Jubbayn 19 June.[17] by the 20th, 89 rebels and 41 government soldiers were dead. The factions were able to repel the attack.[18]

On 28 June 2019, the NLF carried out a raid on the town of al-Hawiz, reportedly killing 15 soldiers and injuring 30.[19] The same day, another L-39 was hit, forcing the aircraft to land.[20]

On 10 July 2019, the operations room captured the city of Hamamiyat and its hill.[21][6] Pro-government Al-Masdar News reported that the Syrian Army recaptured the town the following day.[22] It was reported the coalition also attacked several Syrian Army positions in areas of Latakia.[12]

On 20 July, the operations room repelled an attack on Jubbayn.[18]

On 21 July 2019, the operations room launched an attack on Qasabiyeh, but was repelled by the Syrian Army.[23]

On 28 July 2019, the operations room suffered major setbacks after the Syrian Army recaptured Tal Meleh and Jubbayn, reversing all their gains.[24][25] Sources reported dozens of pro-government fighters including senior generals were killed in clashes with the factions.[26]

The Fateh Mubin operations room lost several key areas including the strategic city of Khan Shaykhun[27] and was forced out of northern Hama. The battle ended with a ceasefire which came into effect on 31 August.[28]

Second northwestern Syria offensive [ edit ]

In December 2019, after renewed airstrikes on rebel-held areas, opposition sources announced the Syrian Army was planning to restart its Idlib offensive.[29] On 19 December, the Syrian Army began the offensive, advancing into several towns.[30] The armed factions were also attacked from the Aleppo axis. The city of Ma'arrat al-Nu'man was captured by the Syrian Army after weeks of bombing amidst an assault on 29 January 2020.[31] Turkey began sending convoys of troops and equipment into Idlib to safeguard against a complete takeover of the province.[32] The Fateh Mubin operations room lost several key cities including the city of Saraqib.[33] Following the reopening of the M5 highway to pro-government forces, the Syrian Army launched an attack on the Aleppo axis, seizing most rebel held areas of the province.[34] On 20 February, backed by Turkish artillery, the rebels launched an attack on the town of Neirab[35] and briefly captured the town, but withdrew after heavy clashes and airstrikes.[36] The rebel factions attempted another advance on the Neirab axis, recapturing the town and the city of Saraqib on 27 February.[37][38] On 1 March, the opposition factions also carried out a counterattack on the Al-Ghab Plain where the Syrian army had been advancing, halting the offensive there and retaking several towns.[39][40] Turkish drone strikes on the SAA and allies turned the tide of the battle in favor of the rebels on several fronts.[41] The city of Saraqib was recaptured by the SAA on 2 March 2020.[42] 3 days later, the battle ended as a ceasefire was agreed to by Turkey and Russia.[43]

Aftermath [ edit ]

On 24 June 2020, SOHR reported that the factions repelled an infiltration attempt by the Syrian Army on the Harsh Binin frontline. The Syrian army shelled rebel positions, while the Turkish Army shelled several positions of the Syrian Army in support of the rebels.[44]

On 25 June 2020, SOHR reported that the NLF repelled an infiltration attempt by the Syrian army on the Bayanin frontline. The Turkish army shelled several positions of the Syrian Army during the clashes.[45] The SOHR reported that the Syrian army attempted a third infiltration attempt back by artillery, but this attack was repulsed at well.[46]

On 26 June 2020, following a conflict with the Guardians of Religion Organization, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham declared Fateh Mubin the only legal coalition in rebel-held Idlib and barred the creation of any other military operation rooms.[47]

On 28 June 2020, SOHR reported that HTS destroyed a heavy machine gun of the Syrian Army in the al-Jaradah area.[48]

On 29 June 2020, SOHR reported that the factions shelled several Syrian Army positions in southern Idlib. They also repelled an attempt by the Syrian army to infiltrate the al-Fterah area,[49] and destroyed a military bulldozer on the Dadikh village frontline.[50]

On 30 June there were reports that the Syrian Army launched an attack and captured several positions on the Ruwaiha axis. A spokesman for the NLF denied the claim.[51]

During early July 2020, SOHR reported clashes and shelling of positions between al-Fateh al-Mubin and pro-government forces took place, as the Syrian Army sent reinforcements to the front lines in Idlib.[52][53][54]

On 10 July 2020, SOHR reported that a Russian UAV was shot down by the NLF during fierce clashes in the Idlib countryside.[55]

Skirmishes and clashes between the operations room and the Syrian Army continued over the course of the year, with the ceasefire agreed to in March regularly being broken with shelling and infiltration attempts.[56]

On 20 December 2020 the operations room repelled an infiltration attempt in Jabal al-Zawiya. Shelling took place between the two sides the following day.[57]

On 4 January 2021, the operations room clashed with the Syrian Army in the Jabal al-Zawiya area.[58]

On 7 January 2021 three soldiers from HTS were killed by Syrian Army shelling near the village of Fateira.[59] HTS reportedly destroyed two vehicles and killed a number of soldiers near Hantoutin village after attacking them with ATGM launchers. A Syrian soldier was shot by a sniper operating under the Fatah Mubin operations room coinciding with shelling by the latter near Dadikh village. The Syrian Army shelled rebel-held areas of Latakia governorate the same day.[60]

On 11 January 2021, a group of Syrian Army soldiers infiltrated positions of NLF group Jaysh al-Nasr in the town of Al-Ankawi during nighttime,[61] killing 11 fighters.[62][63] The NLF responded by shelling Syrian Army positions in northwest Hama and southern Idlib countrysides.[64]

US intervention in the Syrian civil war,Published date not found (newspaper3k),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_intervention_in_the_Syrian_civil_war,"Ongoing military intervention in West Asia

On 22 September 2014, the United States officially intervened in the Syrian civil war with the stated aim of fighting the Islamic State (ISIL/ISIS) terrorist organization in support of the international war against it, code named Operation Inherent Resolve. The US currently continues to support the Syrian Free Army opposition faction and the YPG-led Syrian Democratic Forces.

Shortly after the start of the civil war in 2011, the Obama administration placed sanctions against Syria and supported the Free Syrian Army rebel faction by covertly authorizing Timber Sycamore under which the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) armed and trained rebels. Following the Islamic State's occupation of Eastern Syria in August 2014, the United States conducted surveillance flights in Syria to gather intelligence regarding the Islamic State. In September 2014, the United States-led coalition—which involves the United Kingdom, France, Jordan, Turkey, Canada, Australia, and others—launched an air campaign against the Islamic State and al-Nusra Front inside Syria.

The US missile strike on Shayrat Airbase on 7 April 2017 was the first time the US deliberately attacked Syrian government forces during the war,[168] and marked the start of a series of direct military actions by US forces against the Syrian government and its allies via airstrikes and aircraft shoot-downs, mainly in defense of either the Syrian Democratic Forces or the Syrian Free Army opposition group based in al-Tanf. In mid-January 2018, the Trump administration indicated its intention to maintain an open-ended military presence in Syria to accomplish US political objectives, including countering Iranian influence and ousting Syrian president Bashar al-Assad.[169][170] However, on 19 December, President Trump unilaterally ordered the withdrawal of the 2,000–2,500 US ground troops in Syria at the time, which was to be completed in 2019.[171][172][173] With proliferating concerns over a potential power vacuum, the US announced on 22 February 2019 that instead of a total withdrawal, a contingency force of around 400 US troops would remain garrisoned in Syria indefinitely, and that their withdrawal would be gradual and conditions-based, returning to a policy of open-ended American military presence in the country.[174][175]

In 2019, the coalition saw decisive results in its intervention against the Islamic State; the terror group lost its last remaining territory in Syria during the battle of Baghuz Fawqani[176] and its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi died during a US special forces raid in Idlib in October 2019.[177] The Trump administration ordered all US forces to withdraw from Rojava in early October ahead of a Turkish incursion into the region, a controversial move widely seen as a reneging of the US's alliance with the SDF in favor of NATO ally Turkey.[178] However, by November 2019, US troops instead repositioned to eastern Syria, reinforcing their presence in the al-Hasakah and Deir ez-Zor governorates, with the subordinate mission of securing SDF-controlled oil and gas infrastructure from the IS insurgency and the Syrian government.[179] On 23 November 2019, the head of US Central Command stated there was no ""end date"" on the US's intervention in Syria.[180]

The US Department of Defense stated that there were around 900 US soldiers operating in Syria as of February 2021.[49][181] On 19 December 2024, after the fall of the Assad regime, the Pentagon revealed that there were around 2,000 US troops in Syria, adding that the increase was temporary and occurred in recent months.[182]

Background [ edit ]

Leaked United States diplomatic cables have been seen as showing that regime change in Syria may have been a covert foreign policy goal of the US government in the years leading up to the civil war, even during the period when President Barack Obama was publicly engaging with Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. A 2006 memorandum by US diplomat William Roebuck of the embassy in Damascus stated:

We believe Bashar's weaknesses are in how he chooses to react to looming issues, both perceived and real, such as...the potential threat to the regime from the increasing presence of transiting Islamist extremists. This cable summarizes our assessment of these vulnerabilities and suggests that there may be actions, statements and signals that the USG can send that will improve the likelihood of such opportunities arising. These proposals will need to be fleshed out and converted into real actions and we need to be ready to move quickly to take advantage of such opportunities. Many of our suggestions underline using Public Diplomacy and more indirect means to send messages that influence the inner circle.

According to Seymour Hersh and activist Robert Naiman, Roebuck, who went on to be charge d'affairs of the Libyan embassy under Obama, also considered the advantages of promoting religious sectarianism in Syria.[183][184]

Following the start of the Arab Spring in 2011, protests in Syria against the Assad regime were violently suppressed and a civil war began.[185] By 2012 there were several armed opposition groups operating in the country, including the Free Syrian Army, formed in July 2011 by officers who defected from the Syrian Armed Forces. In 2012, the al-Nusra Front, led by Abu Muhammad al-Julani, was established by the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI) as the official branch of al-Qaeda in Syria. The al-Nusra Front was eclipsed by its own creator, and al-Qaeda severed its ties to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in February 2014, after an eight-month power struggle.[186] Despite clear connections between ISI and the al-Nusra Front, the two organisations never merged during the Syrian Civil War, as al-Julani refused to cede control to ISI and insisted on maintaining al-Nusra Front as a separate entity.[187]

Shortly after the civil war broke out in 2011, the US initially supplied the rebels of the Free Syrian Army with non-lethal aid (e.g., food rations and pickup trucks), but quickly began providing training, money, and intelligence to selected Syrian rebel commanders. At least two US programs attempted to assist the Syrian rebels, including a 2014 Pentagon program that planned to train and equip 15,000 rebels to fight the IS, which was canceled in 2015 after spending $500 million and producing only a few dozen fighters.[188] A simultaneous $1 billion covert program called Timber Sycamore conducted by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) aimed at fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was more successful, but was decimated by Russian bombing, and canceled in mid-2017 by the Trump administration.[188] The Obama administration began surveillance missions on Islamic State positions in Syria in September 2014.[189] On 22 September 2014, the US, Bahrain, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) began to attack ISIL forces inside Syria,[190][191] as well as the Khorasan group in the Idlib Governorate west of Aleppo, and the al-Nusra Front around Raqqa,[31][192] as part of the international military intervention against ISIL.[190][193][194][195]

Timber Sycamore and Syrian Train and Equip Program [ edit ]

At the direction of US President Barack Obama, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was put in charge of operations worth about $1 billion annually to arm anti-government forces in Syria,[196][197][198][199] an operation which formally began in 2013, more than two years after the start of the civil war in 2011. Prior to 2013, the CIA only supplied certain rebel groups of the Free Syrian Army with non-lethal aid, but later began providing training, funding, and intelligence to selected rebel commanders.[200][201][202] Although a former intelligence adviser who spoke to journalist Seymour Hersh claimed the CIA had been facilitating the flow of arms from Libya to Syria in collaboration with ""the UK [United Kingdom], Saudi Arabia and Qatar"" since 2012 or 2011,[203] the first confirmed CIA weapons arrived in Spring 2014: ""There were just a handful, delivered to only one rebel group carefully vetted by the CIA"". The group, Harakat Hazm, or the Steadfast Movement, showed off the new weapons system by posting the first successful strike on YouTube in April.[204] Another of the groups being vetted was the Islamist Army of Mujahedeen, formed in January 2014 specifically to combat ISIL.[204][205] However, there were indications that the Army of Mujahedeen was still being vetted in September 2014.[206]

In addition to the covert CIA program,[207] on 17 September 2014, the US House of Representatives voted to authorize the executive branch to overtly train and equip Syrian rebels against ISIL forces, at a cost of $500 million.[208][209]

July 2014 rescue mission [ edit ]

Following the abduction of a number of foreigners in Syria, on 4 July 2014, the US carried out an operation to rescue foreign hostages being held by ISIL. US airstrikes were conducted against an ISIL military base known as the ""Osama bin Laden Camp"" while at the same time, two dozen US special forces soldiers dropped from helicopters near an ISIL-held building, thought to be for high-value prisoners. No prisoners were found in the building and the soldiers were quickly engaged by ISIL forces dispatched from Raqqa, which started a three-hour firefight.[210] US forces concluded that the hostages were no longer at the site and abandoned the rescue attempt. At least five ISIL fighters were killed and one US soldier was wounded. Jordanian forces were also reportedly involved in the operation, with one Jordanian soldier reportedly wounded, but Jordanian involvement was not confirmed. Later on, it was reported that the hostages had been moved 24 hours before the attempted rescue.[210] Following the mission, it remained unclear whether the operation failed due to bad intelligence or whether ISIL forces were alerted in advance of the mission.[211]

In the aftermath of the rescue mission, and purportedly as a response to airstrikes in Iraq, ISIL beheaded three hostages over a one-month period: Americans James Foley[210] and Steven Sotloff on 19 August and 2 September, respectively,[citation needed] and Briton David Haines on 13 September.[212]

Surveillance flights over Syria [ edit ]

On 26 August 2014, the US began conducting overt surveillance flights, including drones, over Syria to gather intelligence on ISIL targets. The flights began gathering intelligence that would aid future airstrikes even though airstrikes were not yet authorized at that point.[213] No approval was sought from the Assad government for flights entering Syrian airspace.[214]

US-led coalition against ISIL [ edit ]

In June 2014, the Iraqi government formally requested the United States to assist in its struggle against ISIL, following the group's offensive in northern Iraq that same month.[215] Since then, the US led efforts to establish a global coalition to counter ISIL.[216]

In response to this request, various sets of countries convened on 5 September, 15 September[217] and 3 December 2014, to discuss concerted action against ISIL. Present at all three meetings were the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, Turkey and Denmark.

The coalition of 5 September (10 countries) decided to support anti-ISIL forces in Iraq and Syria.[218] On 10 September 2014, US president Barack Obama announced a ""comprehensive"" strategy to counter ISIL that ""in concert with coalition partners [...] will defeat ISIL and deny them safe haven"".[219]

The coalition of 3 December 2014 (sixty countries) that styled itself as the Global Coalition to Counter the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)[220] agreed on a many-sided strategy against ISIL, including cutting off ISIL's financing and funding and exposing ISIL's true nature.[220] As of March 2015, the US-led coalition comprised over sixty countries, that contributed in various ways to the effort.[216]

Support for Kurdish-led ground forces [ edit ]

As the Siege of Kobanî continued there were growing calls to also arm the YPG, also known as the People's Protection Units, a Kurdish fighting force in Syria heavily involved in the defense of Kobanî.[221] On 20 October 2014, the Turkish foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu announced that the Turkish government would be allowing Peshmerga from the Iraqi Kurdistan Regional Government to cross their border into Kobanî to support Kurdish fighters.[222] The change in policy came after the Turkish government had refused to allow Kurdish fighters and supplies to pass through the border to YPG units in Kobanî, as it viewed the YPG as an offshoot of the PKK.[223] On 28 October, Peshmerga from the Iraqi Kurdistan Regional Government departed Erbil to travel to Turkey and eventually to Kobanî.[224] A total of 152 soldiers were deployed starting with forty vehicles carrying weapons, artillery, and machine guns, along with 80 Peshmerga forces, who crossed the border into Turkey by land with the heavy weapons and then drove to the border near Kobanî.[224] The other 72 soldiers in the contingent flew to Turkey and rejoined the rest of the contingent on 29 October.[224] By the start of November, 152 Kurdish Peshmerga from Iraq and 50 Free Syrian Army fighters had crossed the border into Kobanî with heavy weapons, small arms, and ammunition.[19][110]

On 20 October 2014, the United States began airdropping supplies to Syrian Kurdish forces, including the YPG, that were besieging ISIL-controlled Kobanî.[225] Prior to 20 October, the United States and its anti-ISIL coalition partners in Syria had not provided any supplies to Kurdish forces in their fight against the jihadist group.[225] Much of the reason for the US airdropping supplies was due to the Turkish government's refusal to allow supplies to pass through their border into Kobanî. The US specifically airdropped weapons, ammunition, and medical supplies supplied by Iraqi Kurdistan intended to supply the Kurdish forces in Syria.[225] On 21 October, a video was released by ISIL showing what it claimed was a bundle of airdropped small arms, ammunition, and other supplies from the United States. The Pentagon said it was analyzing the video and could not at the time confirm whether the video was authentic but that the materials were similar; the video would subsequently be analyzed by the Department of Defense to verify its authenticity.[226] On 22 October, the Pentagon confirmed that one of its airdrops had been intercepted by ISIL elements but downplayed the incident, saying that it most likely would not give ISIL any real advantage in their overall operations.[227]

On 8 December 2024, following the end of the Assad regime and takeover by the SDF and Syrian opposition, the United States Central Command announced renewed operations and air strikes against ISIL cells and targets within Syria.[228] US President Joe Biden called the regime change as a ""moment of risk"", and clarified that the operations were to ensure that ISIL did not take advantage of the circumstances.[citation needed]

Coalition arming and training of the Syrian opposition [ edit ]

In October 2014, the Turkish government agreed to help train and equip some moderate Syrian rebels in Turkey.[229] By January 2015, the United States was set to send 400 troops and hundreds of support staff to countries neighboring Syria in order to train 5,000 opposition soldiers a year for the next three years.[230] The countries taking part in the train-and-equip program were to include Jordan, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, as well as Turkey.[231] The groups that were expected to be armed and trained by the US government included fighters from the Free Syrian Army.[232] The Pentagon confirmed that it had selected 1,200 Syrian opposition members to begin training in March 2015, with 3,000 to complete training by the end of 2015.[231]

The successful experience in Kobanî had informed US policy in regard to arming Syrian opposition groups other than the Kurdish YPG, with plans to give other groups technicals equipped with radio and GPS equipment to call in airstrikes.[207] John R. Allen, President Obama's envoy to the international coalition against ISIL, stated ""It is clearly part of our plan, that not only we will train them, and we will equip them with the latest weapons systems, but we will also protect them when the time comes"".[233] In March 2015, the United Kingdom announced that it was sending around 75 military instructors to train Syrian opposition forces.[234][235] The train-and-equip program started on 9 May 2015.[236] On 25 May, Turkey and the US agreed ""in principle"" on the necessity to support these forces with air support.[237]

However, only about 200 rebel fighters actually began training, the majority of whom left after being required to agree to fight only against ISIL and not the Assad government.[238] By mid-2015, only a group of 54 such fighters (Division 30) had been deployed—which was quickly routed in an ambush by al-Nusra[239]—and a further 100 had been thus far finished training in Jordan.[240] In September 2015, it was reported that a further 100-120 were being trained in a second wave,[241] with 75 more Division 30 fighters reported to have re-entered Syria at the end of the month; they were immediately attacked by al-Nusra.[242]

Jane's Defence Weekly reported that in December 2015 the US shipped 994 tonnes of weapons and ammunition (including packaging and container weight), generally of Soviet-type equipment from Eastern Europe, to Syrian rebel groups under the ongoing CIA Timber Sycamore operation. A detailed list of weapon types and shipment weights had been obtained from the US government's Federal Business Opportunities website.[243][244] As of July 2016, extensive arms shipments were continuing.[245][246][247]

It was reported in July 2017 that the Donald Trump administration decided to ""phase-out"" the CIA program to equip and train anti-government rebel groups.[248][249][250]

US airstrikes [ edit ]

In his address to the nation on 10 September 2014, US President Obama announced his intention to bomb ISIL targets in Syria and called on Congress to authorize a program to train and arm rebels who were fighting ISIL and the Syrian forces of Bashar al-Assad.[257] For the first time, he authorized direct attacks against the militant group in Syria. In his address, he said the United States were going on offensive, launching ""a steady, relentless effort to take out"" the group ""wherever they exist."" Obama also announced creating of a broader coalition against ISIL.[258]

Commenting on Obama's address, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich [ru] opposed the US intervention against ISIL in Syria ""without the consent of the legitimate government"" and said that ""this step, in the absence of a UN Security Council decision, would be an act of aggression, a gross violation of international law"". Ali Haidar, Syrian minister of national reconciliation, said that ""any action of any kind without the consent of the Syrian government would be an attack on Syria"".[259]

On 17 September, the US House of Representatives approved Obama's plan to train and arm the Syrian rebels in their fight against ISIL. In a statement following the House vote, Obama said that the United States would not send military troops to Syria.[260] The Senate gave final congressional approval to Obama's proposal the next day.[261]

The US did not request permission from the Syrian government, nor did it coordinate its actions with the Syrian government, provide direct notification to the Syrian military or give indication of timing on specific targets, but it did notify the Syrian U.N. representative, which the Syrian government confirmed.[262]

Before the airstrikes began, the United States also informed Iran, the Assad government's largest regional ally, of their intention to launch airstrikes. It did not share specific timing or targets of strikes with the Iranian government but reportedly assured it that the US would not strike any Syrian government targets.[263]

On 8 April 2018, US President Donald Trump called Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad ""Animal Assad"", following suspected chemical attack carried out in the Syrian city of Douma.[264] On 14 April, the United States, France, and the United Kingdom carried out missile strikes against Syria. On 30 May, President Al-Assad responded to the insult, by saying: ""What you say is what you are.""[265]

It was reported in June 2018 that the 441st Air Expeditionary Squadron reportedly maintained an unpaved runway in Sarrin, Raqqa Governorate.[266][267][268]

On 14 June 2020, a US coalition drone strike killed Guardians of Religion Organization leaders Khalid al-Aruri and Bilal al-Sanaani who were driving a vehicle in Idlib.[269] There was reportedly no explosion and the target vehicle was relatively intact, with the roof and windshield impacted from above and one side shredded, leading observers to suggest the munition used was probably the kinetic Hellfire R9X missile that uses blades to eviscerate its target rather than an explosive warhead.[270] On 24 June, Abu Adnan al-Homsi, logistics and equipment commander at the Guardians of Religion Organization, was also killed by a US drone strike.[271]

On 25 February 2021, US military airstrikes commanded by US president Joe Biden destroyed multiple facilities related to pro-Iranian militias including Kata'ib Hezbollah and Kata'ib Sayyid al-Shuhada, at a border control point near al-Hurri village, Abu Kamal District, in retaliation to Erbil missile attacks.[272][273] At least 17 militants were reported killed in the strikes, although the militias only confirmed one.[274] The strikes were conducted by two F15s dropping Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) and was the first overt military operation ordered by the Biden administration.[275]

On 28 June 2021, the US military conducted airstrikes on facilities purportedly used by Iranian-supported militias near the Iraq–Syria border.[276] However, the SOHR stated that at least nine Iran-backed Iraqi militia fighters died, and many others were injured.[277]

Airstrikes on the Khorasan Group [ edit ]

One of the groups targeted by US airstrikes was the Khorasan Group, an extremist group of suspected al-Qaeda ""core"" members who were alleged to have been plotting an attack against the US and other Western nations.[262] The strikes targeted Khorasan training camps, explosives and munitions production facilities, communications facilities, as well as command and control facilities. The group has been claimed to possess advanced bomb making skills and their plot is claimed to involve a bomb made of a nonmetallic device such as a toothpaste container or clothes dipped in explosive material.[278] The group is reportedly led by Muhsin al-Fadhli, a leader of al-Qaeda and a close confidant of Osama bin Laden.[278] Intelligence officials expressed concern that the group may include militants who were taught by Ibrahim al-Asiri, the chief bomb maker for al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, who is known for his sophisticated bomb making techniques that nearly downed two Western airliners.[278]

Later statements by government officials indicated that the threat of a plot may have been less severe than initially reported.[279][280] One official indicated that ""there did not yet seem to be a concrete plan in the works"",[279] while another told The Guardian that ""there was no indication of an imminent domestic threat from the group"" at the time the United States began bombing.[280]

On 6 November, a second round of airstrikes was launched against Khorasan and al-Nusra in northwestern Syria, along with Ahrar ash-Sham at its headquarters in Idlib, whose leadership had been infiltrated by al-Qaeda.[27] On 13 November 2014, the US launched a third set of airstrikes against Khorasan.[281] On 19 November, the US carried out another airstrike on Khorasan near Hazm, which struck and destroyed a storage facility associated with the group.[282] On 1 December, the US carried out another airstrike on Khorasan near Aleppo.[283]

On 24 March 2015, it was revealed that the US airstrikes on Khorasan had killed 17 militants from the group.[284]

On 8 July 2015, a US airstrike near the town of Sarmada in Idlib, Syria, killed Muhsin al-Fadhli, the leader of Khorasan.[93]

Ground operations [ edit ]

Initially, coalition leaders, including US President Obama, said their ground forces would not be used in the fight against ISIL either in Iraq or Syria unless they were local coalition forces.[285] In Iraq, thousands of coalition troops from the US and other nations had been deployed in an advisory capacity; in Syria no ground troops from the coalition were deployed in the beginning of the intervention.[286][287]

In November 2015, the Obama administration began the deployment of US special forces to Syria, with the mission of assisting rebel forces in their fight against ISIL, President Obama then ordered several dozen Special Operations troops into Rojava in northern Syria to assist local fighters battling ISIL, authorizing the first open-ended mission by American ground forces into the country.[288]

ISIL's deputy leader in Syria, Abu Ali al-Anbari, was killed by JSOC special forces operatives in March 2016, in eastern Syria near the Syrian–Iraqi border, while he and three other ISIL members were traveling in a vehicle coming from Raqqa. The US Special Forces ordered him to exit the vehicle, intending to arrest him. When he refused and pulled out an assault rifle instead, US forces fired at the vehicle, killing him and the other passengers on board. US commandos also seized electronics and other documents during the operation for intelligence purposes.[289]

In March 2016, King Abdullah of Jordan said that British forces had helped in the building up of a mechanized battalion in southern Syria, consisting of tribal fighters to combat the Syrian Army.[290]

On 17 March 2016, the day after the declaration of the Federation of Northern Syria, US Defense Secretary Ashton Carter praised the Syrian Democratic Forces as having ""proven to be excellent partners of ours on the ground in fighting ISIL. We are grateful for that, and we intend to continue to do that, recognizing the complexities of their regional role.""[291]

During the SDF's May 2016 offensive against ISIL in Northern Raqqa, US Special Forces were widely reported and photographed to be present, with some of them wearing badges of the Kurdish YPG and YPJ on their uniforms.[292] On 21 May, Joseph Votel, commanding general of US Central Command, completed a secret hours-long trip to northern Syria to visit several locations where there were US special operations forces and meet with local forces the US was helping train to fight ISIL. The visit came as the first of 250 additional US special operations forces were beginning to arrive in Syria to work with local forces. The commander overseeing the war in Syria, at the end of a long Saturday spent touring SDF bases, said ""We do, absolutely, have to go with what we've got"".[293]

In September 2016, the US spokesman for the Combined Joint Task Force – Operation Inherent Resolve (CJTF–OIR) confirmed that the SDF, including the YPG, is also part of the ""vetted forces"" in the train and equip program and would be supplied with weapons. The President of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, condemned this and claimed that the SDF are ""endangering our future"".[294]

In October 2016, US Army Lt. Gen. Stephen J. Townsend, the commander of the international coalition against ISIL, said that the SDF would lead the impending assault on Raqqa, ISIL's then-stronghold and capital, and that SDF commanders would plan the operation with advice from American and coalition troops.[295] From November 2016, more than 300 US Special Operations Forces were embedded to train and advise SDF fighters in the Raqqa offensive.[296]

In March 2017, the Trump administration deployed an additional 400 US Marines to Syria to expand the fight against ISIL in the Raqqa offensive where they could provide artillery support for US-backed local forces that were preparing an assault on Raqqa to liberate the city from IS militants. The deployment marked a new escalation in the US's war in Syria, and put more conventional US troops in the battle that, until then, had primarily used Special Operations units. The 400 Marines were part of the 11th MEU from the Battalion Landing Team 1st Battalion, 4th Marines. They manned an artillery battery of M-777 Howitzers whilst additional infantrymen from the unit provided security; resupplies were handled by part of the expeditionary force's combat logistics element.[297] During the Raqqa campaign alone, this small artillery battalion fired over 40,000 shells (including 34,033 155 mm), more than were used in the entire 2003 invasion of Iraq and only 20,000 fewer than all those fired by the US military in Operation Desert Storm.[298]

In March 2018, SDF press secretary in Deir ez-Zor Mehdi Kobani reportedly told Sputnik Turkiye that US forces were building a ""large military base"" in the oil-rich al-Omar region of Deir ez-Zor as new equipment had been reportedly arriving to US bases in Syria. The al-Omar oilfield is the largest oil deposit in Syria, and was captured by the SDF during their campaign against ISIL in October 2017.[299][300]

2019 drawdown of US ground forces [ edit ]

On 19 December 2018, President Donald Trump announced that he ordered the pullout of all 2,000–2,500 US troops operating in Syria, though no clear timetable was given.[301] A day later, after failing to convince Trump to reconsider his decision to withdraw all American troops from Syria, Jim Mattis announced his resignation as Secretary of Defense.[302] On 3 January 2019, Trump described Syria as ""sand and death"" in defense of troop withdrawal.[303] US operations in al-Tanf would continue indefinitely.[304]

On 16 January 2019, a suicide bombing claimed by ISIL in the SDF-controlled town of Manbij killed four US personnel and injured three servicemen, making it the deadliest attack on Coalition forces in the country since the intervention.[305][306][307] The ISIL attack drew a second round of criticism of the US president's withdrawal order, with critics linking the attack with an emboldening of ISIL terror and insurgent tactics due to the announcement of a US pullout, despite the group's continued loss of territory in Syria.[308] President Trump offered condolences to the families of the slain American citizens on 17 January while he reaffirmed his policy of withdrawing troops.[309] Trump paid tribute to the fallen Americans during a trip to Dover Air Force Base in the US state of Delaware on 19 January, where their remains were received.[310]

On 21 January, an ISIL SVBIED targeted a US convoy accompanied by SDF troops on the Shadadi-Al-Hasakah road in Al-Hasakah province, killing five SDF personnel. Witnesses said the SVBIED rammed into an SDF vehicle by a checkpoint held by Kurdish forces a dozen kilometers outside Shadadi as the US convoy drove past. No Americans were harmed.[311]

CNN reported on 24 January that additional US troops were moved to Syria to help provide security for the pullout of equipment and personnel as they are moved out via air and land routes. US Department of Defense officials said the additional security forces would move around Syria to different locations as needed and may move in and out of the country at times. Troop numbers would also fluctuate as American presence gradually declines. Defense officials declined to give specifics on numbers, locations, or timetables, citing security concerns.[312] Local sources reported to Anadolu Agency on 28 January that around 600 US troops had allegedly entered eastern Syria from western Iraq to help with the withdrawal process, arriving at discreet bases in Harab Isk and Sarrin villages set to be used as main evacuation centers during the withdrawal. The news agency added that the American-controlled airfields in Rmeilan and Tell Beydar would be used to airlift heavy weapons and equipment from the country; the Coalition itself did not confirm these reports.[313]

By the end of January 2019, according to two US officials, more than 10 percent of American equipment and supplies had been removed from Syria, with 3,000 additional personnel brought into the country to facilitate the draw-down of forces. By 9 February, hundreds of US airstrikes and ground support for the SDF continued as the Kurdish-led force began its final assault on the last ISIL holdouts trapped in a small cluster of hamlets in eastern Syria (including Al-Baghuz Fawqani and southern Al-Marashidah) no larger than a few square miles. US officials, including President Donald Trump, believed the SDF would be able to defeat the remaining diehard ISIL fighters ""in days"", bringing an end to ISIL's claim of a territorial caliphate.[314]

On 18 February, Commander-in-Chief of the SDF Mazlum Kobane expressed hopes the US would halt its total pullout. Kobane said there were discussions about perhaps French and British troops supporting them, but demanded 1,000–1,500 US troops stay in Syria to provide ""air cover, air support and a force on the ground"" to help the SDF in its ongoing fight against ISIL. CENTCOM commander Gen. Joseph Votel reiterated the US withdrawal was continuing.[315]

With the general withdrawal continuing, the White House announced late on 21 February that 200 residual US troops would remain in Syria as a ""peacekeeping force"". The peacekeeping deployment would be indefinite.[316] The next day it was revealed the actual number was 400 troops, not 200, as half would be based in Rojava and half at al-Tanf. Officials stated it was a part of an initiative to get NATO allies to commit to a multinational observer force that would establish a ""safe zone"" in Rojava to keep the Kurds and Turks from clashing, to prevent pro-Syrian government forces from attacking the Kurds, and to keep up pressure to prevent an ISIL resurgence. The US was not seeking a United Nations mandate for the deployment and did not envision asking NATO to sponsor the mission, an administration official said at the time, adding that the troops would not technically be ""peacekeepers,"" a term that carries restricted rules of engagement.[317]

On 7 March, Gen. Joseph Votel confirmed that US forces were in no rush to pullout by a specific date, instead saying the completion of the withdrawal was conditional on ISIL no longer posing a security threat to US forces and their allies.[318] By late March, the US continued to stretch the timetable for the pullout. On 29 March, US officials reportedly said the Pentagon's latest plans called for cutting its combat force in northeastern Syria roughly in half by early May 2019, or to about 1,000 troops, and would then pause pullout operations. The military would then reduce the number of forces every six months, depending on conditions on the ground, until it reaches the 400 troops previously approved by the president. Under this plan, the lowest troop numbers would not be reached until autumn 2020. The longer timetable would provide the US more time to negotiate and work out details over the planned multinational safe zone along Turkey's border. Officials cautioned that the timetable was open-ended and still subject to change, with factors ranging from allied troop contributions to new orders from the president himself.[319]

In early May, video emerged online of US forces firing upon an alleged Syrian government barge ferrying oil supplies in the Middle Euphrates River Valley. The video was posted on Facebook by the pro-SDF ""Deir Ezzor Media Center"".[320]

Withdrawal from north Syria [ edit ]

Following the collapse of the August–October 2019 Northern Syria Buffer Zone agreement and subsequent Turkish offensive against the SDF, US ground forces began deliberately withdrawing from many of their bases, outposts, and camps in north Syria around 6 October, including Manbij[321] and the Lafarge cement factory, upon ""precipitous"" orders from the Donald Trump administration.[322] Senior US military officials said that troops abandoned bases as far south as Tabqah and Raqqa and consolidated all personnel and essential equipment near Kobanî to await airlifts and convoys out of the country throughout coming weeks.[323] A US official at the time said the ≈1,000 US troops being withdrawn will mostly reposition in western Iraq but also possibly Kuwait and Jordan. From Iraq, US forces could conduct cross-border operations against ISIL in Syria, as they had done so in the past.[324]

During the withdrawal, which was described in news media as a ""scramble"", reports emerged showing that US and SDF troops had hastily stripped their camps and bases of sensitive materials but left fortifications in place, many of which became immediately occupied by Syrian government and Russian forces as they quickly moved into the region as part of a protection deal, established on 13 October, between the Assad government and Rojava. Video emerged online of Russian troops reportedly exploring an abandoned US outpost near Manbij.[323][325] On 16 October, two Operation Inherent Resolve F-15 jets bombed their section of the Lafarge cement factory base, located between Kobanî and Ayn Issa, ""to destroy an ammunition cache and reduce the facility's military usefulness"" as Turkish-backed militias advanced towards the area. ""The location had been the headquarters of the de facto Defeat-ISIS coalition in Syria,"" Inherent Resolve spokesman Col. Myles Caggins III said, adding that ""No US forces or equipment were ever in jeopardy and remain within separate, secure facilities."" SDF personnel burned their part of the base before departing.[326] On the same day, President Trump commented on the developments by describing the Kurds as ""no angels"", and about Syria, he said: ""Syria may have some help with Russia, and that's fine. It's a lot of sand. They've got a lot of sand over there. So there's a lot of sand there that they can play with"".[327]

On 18 October, after a ""ceasefire"" between Turkish and Kurdish forces was declared a day prior, US Defense Secretary Mark Esper stated that the withdrawal was continuing and that the US would continue to communicate with both Turkey and the SDF. A senior defense official stated that US aircraft would continue to conduct intelligence missions over northeast Syria to monitor the situation there.[328] In late October, Esper said the US forces leaving Syria would head into western Iraq. But after Iraqi leaders said those troops can't stay there, Esper said they will be deployed in Iraq only temporarily before returning to the US[329] According to The New York Times, citing US Defense Department officials, by 30 October at least half of the original ≈1,000 US troops in Syria had withdrawn and was expected to be reduced to roughly 250 personnel, largely concentrated in the Deir ez-Zor region.[330]

On 31 October, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad called President Trump the ""best American president"", saying he was the most transparent foe, due to his audacity to openly discuss seizing Syrian oil.[331]

On 3 November 2019 US and coalition forces departed their strategic military base near the town of Sarrin. US forces removed all their equipment and were seen leaving the base in a convoy of tens of trucks. The base was one of the largest US bases in Syria, a logistics hub that assisted in the anti-ISIL intervention.[332] On 10 November, US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley stated that at least 500 to 600 US troops would remain in Syria and will not exceed 1,000 personnel. It was not clear if that estimate included the ≈200 troops at al-Tanf.[333]

By mid-November, Russian and Syrian government forces had quickly filled the power vacuum left behind by the US in much of northern Syria. The US had withdrawn from its logistics base in Kobanî by 14 November, with Russia announcing it would set up a new helicopter base in Qamishli the same day.[334] On 17 November, Russia's state-owned Zvezda channel aired footage of armed Russian sappers and Military Police seizing control of the Kobanî airbase days prior, with choppers landing on the US-made airstrip there and the Russian flag seen hoisted over the fortification, of which had been hastily stripped of essentials by coalition personnel, only leaving behind toiletries, sleeping facilities, some exercise equipment, and other small items.[335] While Syrian government troops gradually re-established its presence in the region, Russia and Turkey continued to occupy and conduct patrols throughout north east Syria as well, in accordance with the Sochi Agreement.

By 4 December, the US had completed its military pullback from northeastern Syria and had consolidated its troop presence in the country to a ""relatively static"" 600 personnel, according to Mark Esper.[336] The withdrawal from north Syria was partially carried out by the US Army 103rd Expeditionary Sustainment Command's Syria Logistics Cell (SLC), a key component of the Army's 1st Theater Sustainment Command, Special Operations Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve, and Combined Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve.[337]

2019–20: Eastern Syria redeployment [ edit ]

By 20 October 2019,[330] after backlash from the US Congress, the Trump administration had conducted a partial reversal of its 6 October order to pullout 1,000 troops from Syria, instead confirming a newly dedicated mission to guard oil and gas fields and related infrastructure in SDF-controlled eastern Syria from ISIL insurgent attacks. While US forces continued to reduce its presence in northern Syria by the hundreds to avoid Syrian-SDF and Turkish fighting, the US simultaneously shifted more resources south and east into the oil-rich Deir ez-Zor Governorate.[330] Defense Secretary Mark Esper confirmed on 25 October that the US would ""maintain a reduced presence in Syria and deny ISIS access to oil revenue""[330] and, in support of the mission, mechanized and armored units would be deployed to eastern Syria to reinforce the American presence there.[329] Throughout late October-early November 2019, this contingent was reinforced with hundreds of new infantry troops joined by mechanized infantry Armored Brigade Combat Teams (ABCTs) in Bradley IFVs and—according to unnamed sources—potentially tanks, redeployed from Iraq and Kuwait, which was estimated to raise the number of US troops in eastern Syria to around 500 at the time. When coupled with the US garrison at al-Tanf, the contingency force's numbers rise to a flexible 800–900 personnel.[330] In Syria's Deir ez-Zor Governorate, which lies far to the North-East of al-Tanf, the United States has stated that it will increase its presence in SDF controlled territory along the Eastern bank of the Euphrates river and also establish military bases at al-Baghuz, al-Basira, al-Ezba, and the al-Omar oil field.[338]

M2A2 Bradley IFVs of the 4th Battalion, 118th Infantry Regiment accompany a patrol in eastern Syria, 13 November 2019

On 30 October, 4th Battalion, 118th Infantry Regiment, a US combined arms battalion equipped with M2A2 Bradley IFVs deployed to the Deir ez-Zor region to help guard SDF-US controlled oil and gas fields. The battalion is part of the US Army National Guard's 30th ABCT which had begun arriving in Kuwait the week prior to relieve the regular Army 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division in support of Operation Spartan Shield, the US's theater-level contingency force for the Middle East.[339] By 31 October, US forces in M-ATV convoys were seen conducting dedicated patrols of oil and gas-related facilities throughout Syria's al-Hasakah and Deir ez-Zor Governorates, usually accompanied by SDF personnel. The US's deployment of heavy armored vehicles to Syria for the first time in the intervention—as opposed to the lighter armored RG-33s, M-ATVs, Strykers, Armored Ground Mobility Systems,[citation needed] and NSTVs (Non-Standard Tactical Vehicles) US special operations units and regular ground forces have used prior—introduced additional firepower and force protection capabilities for ground forces.[339] Nevertheless, the Bradley IFVs were pulled out of Syria after less than two months of deployment due to unspecified reasons.[340]

On 3 November, OIR officials confirmed that multiple artillery rounds landed about one kilometer from a road with a US convoy; OIR, without offering additional details, stated no personnel were injured and the patrol was not hit. The Russian Defense Ministry were the first to report the incident, adding that the incident was near Tell Tamer and that it was elements of Turkish-backed rebels that fired the artillery.[341] On 4 November, Rudaw briefly interviewed a US special operations soldier during a patrol at an oilfield near Rmelan, who stated that US forces are ""working with the SDF and they're letting us know the situation up here as they see it."" According to North Press Agency, the US patrol had begun in Rmelan and spanned the towns of al-Jawadiyah, al-Malikiyah, and Ain-Diwar.[342] On 15 December, a large US logistical convoy en route to Deir ez-Zor was reportedly seen crossing Semalka into al-Hasakah province from Iraq.[343]

By mid-January 2020, tensions between Russian and US forces in northeast Syria had reportedly grown as US troops had increasingly begun blocking Russian convoys from accessing certain major roads between towns. Both Russia and the US operate military outposts throughout the region as a part of their respective missions.[344] On 25 August, a Russian military vehicle rammed a US armored car near al-Malikiyah, northeastern Syria, in which four US soldiers had suffered mild concussions. Russian defense minister Sergey Shoygu said that ""the US armed forces soldiers tried to block the Russian patrol""; meanwhile, a US defense official said that Russian forces went to a ""security zone"" that they should not enter.[345]

On 30 July 2020, the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria signed an agreement with an American oil company, Delta Crescent Energy LLC, to develop oil fields in the region.[346] The Syrian authorities condemned the agreement, and mentioned that: ""This agreement is null and void and has no legal basis.""[347] Seizing oil without local government permission would be a war crime of pillage.[348]

On 17 August, US forces killed at least one Syrian soldier and wounded two others, after a fire exchange near a checkpoint in the village of Tal Dahab, near Qamishli, northeastern Syria.[349]

On 19 September, the US deployed additional troops, equipment and armored vehicles to north-eastern Syria after tensions with Russia escalated in the region. According to officials, the moves were meant ""to help ensure the safety and security of coalition forces.""[350] US Central Command mentioned that the United States had deployed Sentinel radars and Bradley vehicles to augment forces in the ""Eastern Syria Security Area"" (ESSA).[351] The reinforcements were considered a response to a 26 August incident where a Russian armored vehicle collided with a coalition M-ATV, injuring four US soldiers.[352]

It was reported on 30 November 2020 that an airstrike near the Iraq–Syria border killed an unidentified Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps commander and three other men traveling with him from Iraq and into Syria. The vehicle was struck after it entered Syrian territory. Iraqi security and local militia officials said the commander's vehicle had weapons in it and that pro-Iran paramilitary groups helped retrieve the bodies. Sources did not identify the commander nor elaborate on the exact time of the incident. It was not immediately known who conducted the strike, and Reuters could not independently verify the reports.[353]

2021–present: Continued Iranian—US proxy conflict [ edit ]

US 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry Regiment troops conduct area reconnaissance in Syria, 18 February 2021

On 10 February 2021, Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby told reporters that US troops were not committed to protecting Syrian oil fields except ""for where appropriate under certain existing authorizations to protect civilians."" He added that ""DOD [Department of Defense] personnel or contractors are not authorized to provide assistance to any other private company, including its employees or agents, seeking to develop oil resources in northeastern Syria.""[49] However, there were reports from local sources in northeastern Syria that US forces had transported oil and wheat smuggled from Syria to Iraq.[354]

On 28 June 2021, President Biden directed airstrikes against Iran-backed militia groups close to the Syria-Iraq border.[355] F-15E and F-16 aircraft were used to launch the attack in what the U.S. described as a retaliatory attack against U.S. facilities and personnel in Iraq by militia groups.[356][357] Two operational and weapons storage facilities were targeted in Syria, the U.S. military revealed in a statement.[358] Despite the U.S. not disclosing the information regarding the casualties in the attack, the SOHR stated that at least nine Iran-backed Iraqi militia fighters died, leaving many others injured.[359] Iraqi militia groups aligned with Iran in a statement named four members of the Kataib Sayyed al-Shuhada faction they said were killed in the attack on the Syria-Iraq border. Hours later, U.S. forces in Syria came under fire, following the U.S. strikes on the Syria-Iraqi border.[360] Pro-Iranian militias fired rockets at the American base at Al-Omar Oilfield in Syria in response to U.S. airstrikes.[361] The U.S. coalition responded by firing heavy artillery on Iranian-backed Militias Positions around Al-Mayadin.[362][363] There were no injuries sustained during the attack, the spokesman for Operation Inherent Resolve, Col. Wayne Marotto disclosed.[364][365]

On 10 July 2021, a mortar shell landed near MSS Conoco, with no injuries reported. It was reportedly the fourth attack on or near U.S. troops or diplomats within a week, reportedly including one in which two service members were injured. No group claimed responsibility, but U.S. forces suspected Iran-backed proxy militias of carrying out such attacks.[366]

On 20 October 2021, troops at the al-Tanf garrison were attacked by bomb-laden drones in what Pentagon spokesman John Kirby called a ""complex, coordinated and deliberate attack"". U.S. officials reportedly blamed Iran and its proxy forces for the attack, but publicly declined to specify details of the attack and whether the U.S. was considering retaliation. There were no reports of deaths or injuries. Attacks by small drones carrying munitions have posed a consistent threat to U.S. forces in eastern Syria since at least March 2020, with U.S. forces suspecting ISIL or Iran-backed elements of conducting the attacks, as U.S.-Iranian tensions in the region have persisted.[367]

On 24 August 2022, Joe Biden ordered airstrikes on claimed IRGC and Russian-backed proxy groups in Syria near Deir ez-Zor.[368][369][370] The airstrikes were in retaliation on an attack on the Al-Tanf garrison.[371] The airstrikes were also considered a massive setback in negotiations in order to revive the JCPOA. Airstrikes were also reported on 25 August. Iran strongly condemned the strikes and denied any links with the targets.[372][373] The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights claimed that Liwa Fatemiyoun and the Syrian Army were targeted in the airstrikes.[374]

On 23 March 2023, at 1:38 p.m. local time (UTC+03:00), a kamikaze drone allegedly of Iranian origin struck a coalition base at Abu Hajar Airport near Rmelan, al-Hasakah Governorate in northeastern Syria,[375] killing one United States contractor and injuring five servicemen and second contractor.[376][377][378] The New York Times reported, US officials said the main air defense system at the base was ""not fully operational"" at the time of Thursday's Drone Strike.[379] In retaliation, U.S. President Joe Biden authorized a response with an airstrike on IRGC-linked targets,[380] including a weapons warehouse in the Harabish neighborhood in Deir ez-Zor, and military posts in the al-Mayadin and Abu Kamal countryside,[381] killing 14 people including nine Syrians, according to SOHR.[382][383][384]

On 24 March 2023, 10 rockets were launched at the Green Village near al-Omar oil field which injured another American serviceman.[378] By afternoon, another rocket attack targeted US forces near the oil and gas fields of Conoco, east of Deir ez-Zor.[385] On 30 March, the Pentagon revealed that twelve American were wounded in total with six U.S. troops in Syria suffering traumatic brain injuries due to the two attacks by Iran-backed militias.[386] A little-known militant group known as Liwa Al-Ghaliboun (The Brigade of Those who Prevail)[387] claimed responsibility for the initial drone attack, although some observers believe the group to simply be a front group for a larger Iranian-backed group or the IRGC.

On 18 October 2023, American military bases in Iraq, Iraqi Kurdistan and eastern Syria were attacked by three drones. Pentagon officials insisted that there are few casualties.[388][389][390][391] On 26 October, United States DoD said it conducted airstrikes on two facilities in eastern Syria linked to IRGC-backed militias in retaliation for the attacks.[392]

Turkish involvement [ edit ]

US and Turkish soldiers conduct joint patrols, Manbij outskirts, 1 November 2018

Turkey, a NATO member, has been involved in the Syrian civil war since the beginning of hostilities. Turkey has trained and armed some members of the Free Syrian Army and al-Qaeda in Syria,[393][394] and has been involved in certain spillover incidents. On 2 October 2014, the Turkish Parliament authorized direct military action in both Iraq and Syria including using military force in Syria and Iraq as well as allowing coalition members to use bases in Turkey.[395] Turkey has also stationed troops and tanks on its southern border near the Syrian border city of Kobanî.[396] The Turkish government demanded several things to go along with them intervening against ISIL, including a buffer zone in Northern Syria, a no-fly zone over certain parts of northern Syria, ground troops from other countries, and the training of moderate opposition forces to fight both ISIL and al-Assad.[397][398]

In October 2014, the Turkish Parliament authorized direct military action in both Iraq and Syria, including using military force, as well as allowing Combined Joint Task Force – Operation Inherent Resolve members to use bases in Turkey.[395][396][397][398] The same month, US Vice President Joe Biden accused Turkey of funding al-Nusra and al Qaeda,[399] after which Turkish President Recep Erdoğan demanded an apology, adding that if no apology was made, Biden would become ""history to me.""[400] Biden subsequently apologized.[401]

On 22 February 2015, the Turkish Army mounted an operation across the border to evacuate its soldiers from the Tomb of Suleyman Shah and relocate the tomb. The Turkish convoy of 572 troops in 39 tanks and 57 armoured vehicles transited through Kurdish-held city of Kobanî en route to the tomb. One Turkish soldier was killed in what government of Turkey described as an accident. The success of the operation was announced 22 February by Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu.[402]

Rising anti-American sentiment in Turkey has occurred since the start of the Turkish invasion of northern Syria in January 2018 aimed at ousting Syrian Kurdish forces from the enclave of Afrin. A poll conducted in Turkey during the operation revealed that 90 percent of respondents believed that the United States is ""behind"" the Kurdish PKK and YPG.[403] After the start of the Turkish invasion, US Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis stated that ""Turkey is a NATO ally. It's the only NATO country with an active insurgency inside its borders. And Turkey has legitimate security concerns.""[404] Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Bekir Bozdag urged the United States to halt its support for Kurdish YPG fighters, saying: ""Those who support the terrorist organization will become a target in this battle.""[405]

On 30 April 2023, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan announced that the Turkish National Intelligence Organization had allegedly tracked down and killed ISIS leader Abu al-Hussein al-Husseini al-Qurashi on 29 April.[406] Turkish media reported that the operation occurred at Jindires, in which Abu al-Hussein detonated his suicide vest to avoid being captured.[407] However, the United States could not verify claims by Turkey that its forces killed Abu al-Hussein al-Husseini al-Qurashi.[408]

In August ISIS said Quraishi was killed during clashes with the Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), whom it accused to be agents of Turkish intelligence.[citation needed] The United States believes the HTS is behind the killing despite the latter's denials.[409]

Northern Syria Buffer Zone [ edit ]

US and Turkish soldiers rendezvous in the Northern Syria Buffer Zone, 4 October 2019.

On 15 January 2019, the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he agreed with setting up a 35 km (22 mi) ""safe zone"" in northern Syria, after engaging with US President Donald Trump a few days prior.[410]

On 7 August 2019, after months of negotiations, Turkey and the US reached a deal to create a 115 km (71 mi) buffer zone in northern Syria along the Syria–Turkey border between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Separate from Turkey's own occupation zone in northern Syria, the deal was reached partly to prevent a potential future Turkish ground incursion into Rojava against US-backed Kurdish forces. Under the framework of the deal, the US and Turkey conducted joint troop patrols, and Turkish reconnaissance aircraft would be allowed to monitor the zone. Kurdish YPG and YPJ forces along the Turkish border dismantled their border fortifications, withdrew to a ""security belt"" alongside regular SDF forces, and removed all heavy weapons from the area. In turn, Turkey was not to conduct airstrikes or establish military observation posts in northern Syria, and was not to ""occupy"" the region, as administrative and civil rule was to be relegated to SDF military councils and the Kurdish Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria. According to the SDF, the majority of the zone was not to include any cities or towns.[411]

The buffer zone agreement was proven to be short-lived and collapsed on 7 October, after US President Donald Trump gave his approval for a Turkish ground offensive into Rojava, and ordered the withdrawal of US troops from northern Syria. The agreement was rendered fully obsolete on 9 October, when Turkey launched a ground incursion into Rojava.[412] In response to the offensive, US Senator Lindsey Graham warned that he would ""introduce bipartisan sanctions against Turkey if they invade Syria."" He said he would also ""call for their suspension from NATO if they attack Kurdish forces who assisted the US in the destruction of the ISIS Caliphate.""[413]

Reports of civilian casualties and war crimes [ edit ]

A coalition airstrike on ISIL positions in Kobanî.

On 29 September 2014, several groups including the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), the Aleppo Media Center, and the Local Coordination Committees reported that US strikes hit a grain silo in the ISIL-controlled town of Manbij in northern Syria, killing two civilians.[414]

The SOHR reported ten airstrikes, also targeting various parts of the province of Idlib, killed at least one child and six other civilians. The group said at least 19 civilians had been killed in coalition airstrikes at that time.[415] The Pentagon reported it had no evidence of any civilian casualties from airstrikes targeting militants in Syria.[416] The United States has also acknowledged that its rules to avoid civilian casualties are looser in Syria than those for drone strikes elsewhere.[417]

The SOHR and other activist groups reported that seven civilians were killed when an air strike hit a gas distribution facility near the town of al-Khasham is the eastern Deir al-Zor province on 17 October 2014 and three civilians were killed in an air strike on 16 October 2014 in the north east province of al-Hassakah. According to their reports, most of the civilians killed were fuel tanker drivers.[418]

According to Reuters, 50 civilians were killed in Syria by US-led airstrikes, from the start of the campaign in late September 2014 to mid-November.[419] On 28 December 2014, a US airstrike in the northern Syrian town of Al-Bab killed more than 50 civilians.[420]

On 21 May 2015, the United States admitted it ""probably"" killed two children in bombings near Harem on 4 and 5 November 2014. These are the first such admissions of the campaign, and followed a military investigation. A similar investigation regarding an event in Syria is underway, and two regarding events in Iraq.[421] Two adult civilians were also minorly injured in the Harem strikes. The deaths and injuries are attributed by the military investigation to unintentional secondary explosions, after the bombers hit their intended targets, linked to the Khorasan.[422] On 19 July 2016 a coalition led airstrike on the ISIL controlled villages of Tokhar and Hoshariyeh reportedly killed at least 56 civilians, including 11 children.[423] On 3 August 2016, dozens of civilians were killed after an airstrike in al-Qa'im, some sources claiming that 30 were killed.[424]

Airwars, which ""maintains an extensive database of all known allegations in which civilians and friendly forces have been reported killed by the Coalition since August 2014"", reports between 503 and 700 civilians were killed by Coalition airstrikes in Syria as of April 2016.[425]

At least 33 people were killed in a US-led coalition airstrike on a school near Raqqa in March 2017.[426] On 16 March 2017, a US airstrike in rebel-held Aleppo killed at least 46 people and wounded more than 100 after warplanes hit a mosque.[427]

A destroyed neighborhood in Raqqa in August 2017

According to a report by Amnesty International, the US-led Coalition has provided falsified data to conceal the actual number of civilian deaths resulting from their bombing campaigns and is ""deeply in denial"" about civilian casualties in Raqqa. After an investigation by Amnesty International in June 2018, the US-led Coalition confirmed that ""coalition air strikes killed 70 civilians, mostly women and children—including 39 members of a single family.""[428]

According to Airwars,[429] the strikes of US-led coalition killed as many as 6,000 civilians in Syria and Iraq in 2017.[430]

On 2 May 2018, Britain's Ministry of Defense admitted for the first time that a civilian was ""unintentionally"" killed in an anti-ISIL drone strike on 26 March 2018. According to the MoD, the civilian was on a motorbike and entered the target area at the last minute. Defense Secretary Gavin Williamson said the incident was ""deeply regrettable"".[431][432]

On 18 March 2019, during the Battle of Baghuz Fawqani, a US special operations-led airstrike killed up to 80 people, including 64 civilians, almost exclusively women and children, and 18 ISIL militants, according to The New York Times. The site of the strike was bulldozed and the incident was covered up by the US military until a New York Times report exposed the cover-up in November 2021.[433] A US military investigation in May 2022 concluded that the airstrike killed 52 ISIL fighters and 4 civilians and did not violate the laws of war.[434]

On 25 April 2019 a joint investigation by Amnesty International and Airwars of over 200 strike sites reported that anti-ISIL Coalition bombing during the 2017 Battle of Raqqa had killed 1,600 civilians alone. CJTF-OIR reported the month prior that its 4-year operations over both Iraq and Syria amounted to 1,257 civilian casualties overall. ""Coalition forces razed Raqqa...Amnesty International and Airwars call upon the Coalition forces to end their denial about the shocking scale of civilian deaths and destruction caused by their offensive in Raqqa,"" the investigators said in a joint statement. The Coalition responded that they ""continue to employ thorough and deliberate targeting and strike processes to minimize the impact of our operations on civilian populations and infrastructure.""[435]

By August 2023, Airwars estimated 8,198–13,258 civilian deaths in Iraq and Syria due to Coalition airstrikes, including 1,725–2,367 children, 1,120-1,460 women, and 3,722 named victims. The Coalition's own estimate of civilian deaths was 1,417. Coalition airstrikes also wounded between 5,883 and 9,111 civilians.[436]

The US-led air campaign inflicted heavy losses on the Islamic State and, alongside special forces operations, artillery strikes, and material and intelligence support to the SDF, catalyzed the loss of the bulk of ISIL's Syrian territory. By late 2015, coalition planes were dropping or launching an average of 67 bombs or missiles a day.[437]

According to CJTF-OIR, by May 2016, ISIL had lost 25 percent of the territory it possessed in Syria since the campaign began, mostly due to advances by YPG/SDF forces with heavy Coalition air support.[438] By the end of 2016 the US-led air campaign against ISIL in both Iraq and Syria was estimated by the Pentagon to have struck 32,000 targets (including 164 tanks, 400 Humvees, and 2,638 pieces of oil infrastructure) and killed 50,000 militants, with approximately 1/3 of the losses taking place in Syria.[40][439]

By August 2017, CJTF-OIR had flown 168,000 sorties in both Syria and Iraq (mostly against ISIL).[40] By December 2017, the Pentagon increased the estimate to 80,000 ISIL fighters killed by coalition airstrikes between Iraq and Syria.[440] By the end of 2018, the SDF, assisted by the coalition, had liberated over 20,000 square kilometers of territory, and three million Syrian civilians from the Islamic State.[441]

By 23 March 2019, the day of ISIL's territorial collapse in Syria, CJTF-OIR and partner forces had liberated nearly 110,000 square kilometres (42,000 sq mi) from the Islamic State; as a result, 7.7 million people no longer lived under ISIL's ""caliphate"".[442]

The United Nations estimated in August 2020 that over 10,000 ISIL insurgents remained in Syria and Iraq.[443]

Reactions [ edit ]

Domestic US approval [ edit ]

The intervention was initially conducted with strong domestic US support; according to Gallup polling in 2014, 61% of Americans supported intervention against ISIL in both Iraq and Syria, while 30% were opposed, and 9% undecided.[444] A larger CCGA poll taken in 2016 showed that 72% of Americans supported ""conducting airstrikes against violent Islamic extremist groups in Syria"", while 58% also supported ""sending special operations forces into Syria to fight violent Islamic extremist groups."" Additionally, a slim majority (52%) supported ""enforcing a no-fly zone over parts of Syria, including bombing Syrian air defenses."" However, only 26% supported ""sending arms and other supplies to anti-government rebel groups in Syria.""[445]

A CNN poll conducted between 17 and 20 October 2019 (during a withdrawal of US troops from northern Syria amid a Turkish offensive there) showed that 75% of Americans were generally concerned about the situation in Syria, with 43% saying they were ""very concerned"". 51% thought the US had a responsibility to remain involved in the Syrian conflict (seven months after ISIL's final Syrian settlement had fallen), while 43% did not.[446]

Syrian reactions [ edit ]

International reactions [ edit ]

In a Pew poll taken in 2015, a median of 62% of people across the nations polled said they support American military efforts against the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria, while a median of 24% were opposed. Among those in support were 78% of Lebanese, 77% of Jordanians, 48% of Turks, 53% of Palestinians, and 84% of Israelis, as well as 81% of French, 66% of British, and 62% of Germans.[454]

Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for the Russian President Vladimir Putin, described the US air strikes on the Shayrat airbase as ""an act of aggression against a sovereign state delivered in violation of international law under a far-fetched pretext.... a serious blow to Russian-US relations, which are already in a poor state"". [ 468 ]

Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov referred to the Sharyat attack as ""an act of aggression under a completely invented pretext"". He compared events in April 2017 to ""the situation of 2003, when the USA, the UK and several of their allies invaded Iraq without the UN Security Council's approval—a grave violation of international law—but at that point they at least tried to show some material evidence.""

Conflict in Syria,Published date not found (newspaper3k),https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/conflict-syria,"On December 8, 2024, the Bashar al-Assad regime fell following a ten-day offensive carried out by rebel forces, beginning with the rebels’ seizure of Aleppo on November 30. The armed coalition was led by Islamist militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA). The upheaval put an end to over fifty years of the Assad family’s rule of Syria and four years of largely frozen dynamics in the Syrian civil war, which has been ongoing since 2011. Amid the fall of the capital city, Damascus, to HTS and aligned forces, deposed President Assad fled to Moscow. Rebels freed Assad regime prisoners throughout the offensive as they seized new territory. Russia, Iran, and Hezbollah—longtime supporters of Assad’s government—did not send significant support to his Syrian Arab Army (SA) during the rebel offensive. Concurrently, the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Defense Forces (SDF), which controls parts of northeastern Syria, continue to clash with Arab tribes that accuse the group of discrimination while Turkey and its proxies continue attacks on Kurdish forces. Factionalized fighting has made space for the self-proclaimed Islamic State to maintain a presence and launch attacks. Additionally, Israel regularly strikes Iranian and Syrian military positions in Syria and has increased attacks, including hitting the Damascus and Aleppo airports, since Hamas’s October 2023 attack on Israel.

Background

What began as protests against President Assad’s regime in 2011 quickly escalated into a full-scale war between the Syrian government—backed by Russia and Iran—and anti-government rebel groups—backed by the United States and a rotating number of U.S. allies, including France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Jordan, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Three campaigns drove the conflict: coalition efforts to defeat the self-proclaimed Islamic State, violence between the Syrian government and opposition forces, and military operations against Syrian Kurds by Turkish forces.

The Islamic State began seizing control of territory in Syria in 2013. After a series of terrorist attacks coordinated by the Islamic State across Europe in 2015, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France—with the support of Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and other Arab partners—expanded their air campaign in Iraq to include Syria. Together, these nations have conducted over eleven thousand air strikes against Islamic State targets in Syria, while the U.S.-led coalition has continued its support for ground operations by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). Turkish troops have been involved in ground operations against the Islamic State since 2016 and have launched attacks against armed Kurdish groups in Syria.

Meanwhile, at the request of the Syrian government in September 2015, Russia began launching air strikes against what it claimed were Islamic State targets, while Syrian government forces achieved several notable victories over the Islamic State, including the reclamation of the city of Palmyra. According to the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State, Iraqi security forces and the SDF have reclaimed 98 percent of the territory formerly held by the group in Iraq and Syria, including the cities of Raqqa and Deir al-Zour.

With Russian and Iranian support, the Syrian government has steadily regained control of territory from opposition forces, including the opposition’s stronghold in Aleppo in 2016. The regime has been accused of using chemical weapons numerous times over the course of the conflict, resulting in international condemnation in 2013, 2017, and 2018. Opposition forces have maintained limited control in Idlib, in northwestern Syria, and on the Iraq-Syria border. However, the 2023 Turkey-Syria earthquake has made effective governance nearly impossible, as the opposition forces have scrambled to meet the needs of citizens.

Efforts to reach a diplomatic resolution have been unsuccessful. Geneva peace talks on Syria—a UN-backed conference for facilitating a political transition led by UN Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura—have been unsuccessful in reaching a political resolution, as opposition groups and Syrian regime officials struggle to find mutually acceptable terms for resolving the conflict. A new round of peace talks began in Geneva in May 2017 with an eighteen-person delegation from Syria but has since stalled. Also in 2017, peace talks initiated by Russia in Astana, Kazakhstan, with Iran, Turkey, and members of Syria’s government and armed opposition leaders resulted in a cease-fire agreement and the establishment of four de-escalation zones. However, shortly after the cease-fire was announced, attacks by Syrian government forces against rebel-held areas in the de-escalation zones resumed.

Under the President Donald J. Trump administration, the United States largely withdrew from Syria, leaving only about 400 U.S. troops as a contingency force. On January 16, 2019, an attack in Manbij claimed by the self-proclaimed Islamic State killed at least nineteen people, including four Americans. Prior to that attack, only two Americans had been killed in action in Syria since the U.S.-led campaign began. The U.S.-led international coalition continues to carry out military strikes against the remnants of the Islamic State, as well as a number of Iranian-backed militias.

The departure of most U.S. troops increased uncertainty around the role of other external parties to the conflict—including Iran, Israel, Russia, and Turkey—as well as the future of internal actors. Growing Russian involvement has been instrumental in the Syrian government’s success in reclaiming territory. While Russia has publicly stated that it only provides air support to the regime, it has sent the Wagner Group, a private military contractor, to fight in Syria. Ongoing violence and proxy conflicts have also facilitated the resurgence of extremist groups.

Meanwhile, the humanitarian situation in Syria remains dire, with 7 out of 10 Syrians requiring humanitarian assistance. According to estimates from the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, more than 600,000 people have been killed since the start of the war. In its 2023 Global Appeal, the United Nations reported that more than 6.9 million are currently internally displaced, with more than 5.4 million living as refugees abroad. Many refugees have fled to Jordan and Lebanon, straining already weak infrastructures and limited resources. More than 3.4 million Syrians have fled to Turkey, and many have attempted to seek refuge in Europe.

Recent Developments

On February 6, 2023, a 7.8 magnitude earthquake and 7.5 magnitude aftershock struck southeast Turkey and northwest Syria, representing one of the worst natural disasters of this century. Estimates in May 2023 put the death toll at almost 60,000, with 50,700 casualties in Turkey and 8,400 in Syria. Syria’s twelve years of conflict have severely hindered its relief efforts—the head of the World Food Programme described the situation as a “catastrophe on top of catastrophe.” In Syria alone, the earthquake is estimated to have caused $5.1 billion in damages.

Earthquake response efforts were complicated by the territorial divisions stemming from Syria’s civil war. The northwest corner of Syria most affected by the earthquake is held by rebel forces, and the Syrian government has long restricted access to the region. Consequently, international aid needed to be approved by the Turkish government to transit the sole humanitarian aid corridor between Syria and Turkey, known as the Bab al-Hawa crossing. However, the earthquake badly damaged the roads linking Turkey to Syria, and the Turkish government was absorbed with its own relief efforts. The first United Nations aid convoy reached Bab al-Hawa on Thursday, February 9. On Friday, February 10, the Syrian government announced it would grant permission to international aid groups to access rebel-held areas of Syria, but did not provide a timeline for doing so.

In May 2023, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi met with President Bashar al-Assad in Damascus to strengthen economic cooperation—marking the first visit of an Iranian president to Syria since the war. Later that month, the Arab League agreed to re-admit Syria after a twelve-year suspension, despite the persistence of Western sanctions against President Assad’s government that could deter oil-rich Arab countries from investment in Syria. In July 2023, Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudan discussed drug trafficking, the return of Syrian refugees, and the removal of the Western sanctions with President Assad in Damascus.

Throughout August 2023, the Syrian army was subject to various Islamic State and Israeli military attacks. Attacks by Islamic State sleeper cells in Syria, especially in the vast desert areas they once controlled, have increased throughout 2023. For example, a bus carrying Syrian soldiers in the eastern desert province of Deir Ezzor was ambushed by the Islamic State, killing twenty-three. Meanwhile, an Israeli missile attack near Damascus in early August killed at least four Syrian soldiers and wounded four others. Although Israel has carried out attacks against what it has described as Iran-linked targets in Syria for years, the number and scope have increased following the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel. Since December, Israeli strikes in and around Damascus have killed more than half a dozen members of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), among them one of Iran’s top intelligence officials.

Conversely, Iran-backed militia groups in Syria and Iraq that oppose Israel’s campaign in Gaza have attacked U.S. troops in the region at least 165 times since the Israel-Hamas War began. There are currently 900 U.S. troops stationed in Syria to prevent a resurgence of Islamic State activity. Since mid-October 2023, American bases in Iraq and Syria have been subject to attacks from these various groups. On November 23, U.S. and international forces in northeastern Syria and Iraq were attacked with drones and rockets four times in twenty-four hours. In February 2024, the U.S. conducted a series of retaliatory strikes following an attack in Jordan on a U.S. military outpost near the Syrian border that killed three U.S. soldiers. The strikes included more than eighty-five targets throughout Iraq and Syria, though U.S. officials have signaled that these strikes were only the start of their response. In response, Iran-backed militias have begun a series of new strikes on U.S. bases, with a drone strike in the eastern province of Deir el-Zour in Syria killing seven and injuring at least eighteen other Kurdish fighters.",Center For Preventive Action,https://microsites-live-backend.cfr.org/cdn/ff/r2GdRBGfLdwnsX2r6WneOYwlArPRqk6lATmgxrb4USA/1693246443/public/2023-08/Syria_08.jpg

Syria: Military ends operation against Assad loyalists – DW – 03,Published date not found (newspaper3k),https://www.dw.com/en/syria-military-ends-operation-against-assad-loyalists/a-71874745,"The days-long conflict has been among Syria's deadliest in a decade. Nearly 1,000 civilians have been killed, including women and children, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

Syria's Defense Ministry announced the end of military operations against loyalists of ousted President Bashar Assad along the Mediterranean coast on Monday, in what has been among the bloodiest conflicts in a decade.

The violence erupted after Assad loyalists ambushed a Syrian security patrol last week, leading to intense clashes and a series of revenge killings targeting Assad's Alawite sect.

The clashes killed 973 civilians, including women and children, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) on Monday. Those targeted included civilians who were not members of the Alawite sect.

What else do we know about the clashes?

Syria's new authorities launched an investigation into the conflict Image: Karam al-Masri/REUTERS

Defense Ministry spokesperson Hassan Abdel-Ghani said that public institutions were now able to resume work and offer services.

""We were able to absorb the attacks from the remnants of the former regime and its officers. We shattered their element of surprise and managed to push them away from vital centers, securing most of the main roads,"" Abdel-Ghani said, in statements carried by the state news agency SANA.

The SOHR reported on Monday that a total of 39 ""massacres"" were reported since the violence erupted last week in Latakia, once the stronghold of the Assad family. It then spread to Tartus, Hama and Homs. The Mediterranean coast is seen as the Alawite heartland in Syria.

Widespread revenge operations against the Alawites were reported amid the clashes, with the SOHR describing them as ""ethnic cleansing."" The killings have been accompanied by the burning of homes and forced displacement.

Tensions have been escalating since Assad's ouster last December, with sectarian attacks continuing despite promises from Syria's interim rulers of the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) to preserve inclusivity and protect minorities.

Assad loyalist gunmen overwhelmed government security forces during their ambush and briefly seized the hometown of the ousted president, Qardaha. Damascus struggled to send reinforcements.

Who are the Alawites?

The Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shia Islam, was a key support base for Assad's government in the Sunni-majority country.

The fighting has killed hundreds of security forces as well as pro-Assad fighters in Latakia, once the stronghold of the Assad family Image: Karam al-Masri/REUTERS

Many of Assad's opponents viewed his rule as granting privileges to the Alawite community.

During the civil war, militant groups emerged across Syria, often treating Alawites as allies of Assad and his backers, Russia and Iran.

What have the international reactions been?

Both the Kremlin and Tehran condemned on Monday the violence in Syria and called for it to end as soon as possible.

Iran's Foreign Ministry also denied any involvement in the violence. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told the French AFP news agency last Friday that Tehran has remained ""an observer” since Assad's overthrow.

China's Foreign Ministry called for an immediate halt to the fighting. Meanwhile the French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot also condemned the violence, stating that ""those responsible must be punished.”

Syria's interim government has promised a transition to a political system that includes the country's diverse religious and ethnic groups through fair elections. Interim President Ahmad Al-Sharaa, a former leader of the Sunni HTS, has made assurances of inclusivity, but many remain doubtful about whether true representation will be achieved.

Syria’s government signs a breakthrough deal with Kurdish-led authorities in the northeast,2025-03-10T12:02:58,https://apnews.com/article/syria-hts-clashes-alawites-sunnis-lattakia-assad-b92c8532c40a3c7105ba32307ffaef48,"JABLEH, Syria (AP) — Syria’s interim government signed a deal Monday with the Kurdish-led authority that controls the country’s northeast, including a ceasefire and the merging of the main U.S.-backed force there into the Syrian army.

The deal is a major breakthrough that would bring most of Syria under the control of the government, which is led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham that led the ouster of President Bashar Assad in December.

The deal was signed by interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa and Mazloum Abdi, the commander of the U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces.

The deal to be implemented by the end of the year would bring all border crossings with Iraq and Turkey, airports and oil fields in the northeast under the central government’s control. Prisons where about 9,000 suspected members of the Islamic State group are also expected to come under government control.

Syria’s Kurds will gain their “constitutional rights” including using and teaching their language, which were banned for decades under Assad. Hundreds of thousands of Kurds, who were displaced during Syria’s nearly 14-year civil war, will return to their homes. Thousands of Kurds living in Syria who have been deprived of nationality for decades under Assad will be given the right of citizenship, according to the agreement.

The deal also says all Syrians will be part of the political process, no matter their religion or ethnicity.

Syria’s new rulers are struggling to exert their authority across the country and reach political settlements with other minority communities, notably the Druze in southern Syria.

Earlier on Monday, Syria’s government announced the end of the military operation against insurgents loyal to Assad and his family in the worst fighting since the end of the civil war.

The Defense Ministry’s announcement came after a surprise attack by gunmen from the Alawite community on a police patrol near the port city of Latakia on Thursday spiraled into widespread clashes across Syria’s coastal region. The Assad family are Alawites.

“To the remaining remnants of the defeated regime and its fleeing officers, our message is clear and explicit,” said Defense Ministry spokesperson Col. Hassan Abdel-Ghani. “If you return, we will also return, and you will find before you men who do not know how to retreat and who will not have mercy on those whose hands are stained with the blood of the innocent.”

Abdel-Ghani said security forces will continue searching for sleeper cells and remnants of the insurgency of former government loyalists.

Though the government’s counter-offensive was able to largely contain the insurgency, footage surfaced of what appeared to be retaliatory attacks targeting the broader minority Alawite community, an offshoot of Shia Islam whose adherents live mainly in the western coastal region.

Sajid Allah Al-Deek, a security official in the coastal region, told The Associated Press that security forces were deployed in the area from the Latakia governorate to Jableh and that the coastal highway is functioning again after being closed because of the fighting.

“The civilians have begun returning to their homes,” Al-Deek said, adding that authorities have started detaining those blamed for acts of violence.

Imad Baytar said his father, who worked for a taxi company, had gone from Jableh to Damascus and on his way back over the weekend “he was killed in the checkpoint.” Baytar blamed Assad supporters for the killing.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, said 1,130 people were killed in the clashes, including 830 civilians. The AP could not independently verify these numbers.

Al-Sharaa said the retaliatory attacks against Alawite civilians and mistreatment of prisoners were isolated incidents, and vowed to crack down on the perpetrators as he formed a committee to investigate.

Still, the events alarmed Western governments, who have been urged to lift economic sanctions on Syria.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio in a statement Sunday urged Syrian authorities to “hold the perpetrators of these massacres” accountable. Rubio said the U.S. “stands with Syria’s religious and ethnic minorities, including its Christian, Druze, Alawite, and Kurdish communities.”

Syria announces end of military operation against al-Assad loyalists,2025-03-10T00:00:00,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/10/syria-announces-end-of-military-operation-against-al-assad-loyalists,"Defence Ministry spokesman says security threats had been neutralised in al-Assad strongholds of Latakia and Tartous.

Syria’s government has ended a security operation in the country’s western coastal region, home to loyalists of former leader Bashar al-Assad, the Ministry of Defence in Damascus reported.

Spokesperson Hassan Abdul Ghani made the announcement on Monday, saying in a statement on X that security threats had been neutralised in Latakia and Tartous provinces. More than 1,000 people, including many civilians, are reported to have been killed in days of deadly violence that prompted international concern.

“Having achieved [the neutralisation of the security threats] we announce the end of the military operation,” Ghani said. “We were able … to absorb the attacks of the remnants of the toppled regime and its officers” and push them from “vital” locations.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Monday that nearly 1,500 people had been killed in the violence since Thursday.

The majority, the war monitor reported, were civilians killed by security forces and allied groups in the heartland of the Alawite minority, to which deposed President Bashar al-Assad belongs. Al Jazeera has not verified the report.

Syria’s interim leader President Ahmed al-Sharaa of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) pledged on Sunday to hunt down the perpetrators of the violent clashes and said he would hold to account anyone who overstepped the new rulers’ authority.

Al-Sharaa’s office also said it was forming an independent committee to investigate the clashes and killings carried out by both sides.

Abdul Ghani added on Monday that the security forces would cooperate with the investigation committee, offering full access to uncover the circumstances of the events, verify the facts and ensure justice for the wronged.

“We were able to absorb the attacks from the remnants of the former regime and its officers. We shattered their element of surprise and managed to push them away from vital centres, securing most of the main roads,” he said.

Rising instability

“We are paving the way for life to return to normal and for the consolidation of security and stability,” Abdul Ghani said, adding that plans were in place to continue combating the remnants of the former government and eliminate any future threats.

However, following relative calm in the weeks following al-Assad’s fall in December, instability and violence are starting to grow in Syria.

Security forces reported that they had repelled an attack on a security checkpoint in the capital, Damascus, overnight.

Al Jazeera’s Resul Serdar, reporting from the capital, said two attackers, who were trying to target a government building, were arrested. Other gunmen managed to escape, the security forces told him.

“It’s still not clear if they are also part of the remnants of the old regime, or a separate group who wanted to attack,” Serdar said.

“It has been an intense week here in the heart of Damascus.”

The fighting on the Mediterranean coast began last week when pro-Assad forces coordinated deadly attacks on the new government’s security forces.

The ambush spiralled into revenge killings as thousands of armed supporters of Syria’s new leadership flocked to coastal areas.

Estimates suggest about 1,000 civilians were killed amid indiscriminate attacks, including reports of brutal murders.

The government then sent reinforcements to Latakia and Tartous in order to regain control.

‘100 percent misleading’

Iran, a long-term al-Assad ally, denied on Monday any involvement in the violence.

Media reports including from the Saudi-owned Al Arabiya TV channel have suggested that Iran and allied groups in the region were behind the violence.

Al-Sharaa had blamed the violence on “attempts by the remnants of the toppled regime and foreign parties behind them to create renewed sedition and pull our country into civil war”.

Regional media had then followed up by pointing the finger at Tehran.

However, a spokesman for Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs rejected the accusation and condemned attacks on minorities in Syria.

“This accusation is completely ridiculous and rejected, and we think that pointing the finger of accusation at Iran and Iran’s friends is wrongly addressed, a deviant trend, and a hundred percent misleading,” Esmaeil Baghaei said.

“There is no justification for the attacks on parts of the Alawite, Christian, Druze and other minorities, which have truly wounded the emotions and conscience of both the countries of the region and internationally,” he added.

Tehran helped to prop up al-Assad during the country’s long civil war and provided him with military advisers.

Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Friday that Tehran has remained “an observer” of the situation in Syria since the takeover by HTS.

“We have no relationship with the current Syrian government, and we are not in a hurry in this regard,” he said.",,https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/12882184-1741605634.jpg?resize=1200%2C675
Civil Conflict in Libya,Published date not found (newspaper3k),https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/civil-war-libya,"More than a decade after a U.S.-backed intervention toppled Libya’s authoritarian leader in 2011, political divisions and cascading security crises continue to threaten Libya’s stability. After a 2020 cease-fire ended the country’s six-year civil war between rival political factions, a UN-supported process led to the formation of a Government of National Unity (GNU). Due to rival factions’ unwillingness to agree on rules overseeing national elections scheduled for December 2021, the vote was postponed indefinitely. Widespread frustration from actors on both sides of the political divide has put pressure on the GNU to hold the long-overdue elections without delay, but little progress has been made. Reflecting the relatively low levels of violence since 2020, the humanitarian situation has eased in recent years. In 2023, approximately three hundred thousand people needed humanitarian assistance in Libya, down from 1.3 million [PDF] in 2016. But compounding threats have posed new challenges for the country, including the worsening effects of a precarious and oil-dependent economy, arms proliferation, climate change, and complex migration crises.

Background

Libya has struggled [PDF] to rebuild state institutions since the ouster and subsequent death of former leader Muammar al-Qaddafi in October 2011. Libya’s transitional government ceded authority to the newly elected [PDF] General National Congress (GNC) in July 2012. The GNC faced numerous challenges over the next two years, including the September 2012 attack by Islamist militants on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi and the spread of the Islamic State and other armed groups throughout the country.

In May 2014, General Khalifa Haftar launched Operation Dignity, a campaign conducted by the Libyan National Army (LNA) to attack Islamist militant groups across eastern Libya, including in Benghazi. To counter this movement, Islamist militants and armed groups—including Ansar al-Sharia—formed a coalition called Libya Dawn. Eventually, fighting broke out at Tripoli’s international airport between the Libya Dawn coalition, which controlled Tripoli and much of western Libya, and the Dignity coalition, which controlled parts of Cyrenaica and Benghazi in eastern Libya, escalating the conflict into a full-fledged civil war.

The battle for control over Libya crosses tribal, regional, political, and religious lines. Each coalition has created governing institutions and named military chiefs—and each has faced internal fragmentation and division. To find a resolution to the conflict and establish a unity government, then-UN Special Envoy to Libya Bernardino Leon, followed by Martin Kobler, facilitated a series of talks between the Tobruk-based House of Representatives (HoR)—based in Libya’s east and a key supporter of Haftar—and the Tripoli-based GNC. The talks resulted in the creation of the Libyan Political Agreement [PDF] and the UN-supported Government of National Accord (GNA) in December 2015. However, the GNA faced obstacles to creating a stable, unified government in Libya.

Taking advantage of the widespread political instability, armed Islamist groups, including Ansar al-Sharia—the terrorist group allegedly responsible for the attack on the U.S. consulate in 2012—and the Islamic State, have used the country as a hub to coordinate broader regional violence, further complicating efforts to create a unity government. After seizing territory [PDF] in Benghazi, Derna, and Ajdabiya, the Islamic State’s power in Libya peaked in 2016 when it captured the coastal city of Sirte—formerly the group’s most significant stronghold outside of Syria and Iraq. While in control, its members committed numerous human rights abuses for which they now face trial in Libya. In July 2018, Haftar announced that the LNA had recaptured the city of Derna, the last outpost of the Islamic State militants in eastern Libya. However, the group continues to operate throughout the country.

Though the Islamic State was largely defeated in Libya in 2016, the GNA and HoR remained divided on a path to unification. In August 2018, violence in Tripoli ended the relative calm maintained for over a year. However, the UN quickly brokered a September 2018 cease-fire between the involved militias.

Foreign states have also taken an interest in Libya, with Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), France, and Russia backing Haftar’s LNA and Turkey, Qatar, and Italy supporting the UN-backed GNA. Egypt and the UAE have been particularly involved with military support for Haftar, as they fear the GNA’s connections to political Islam and the Muslim Brotherhood. Russia also allows the Wagner Group to aid Haftar in exchange for favorable strategic access to ports and other transit centers. Meanwhile, Turkey supports the GNA because of maritime oil and gas deals they have brokered. The other foreign backers have taken a more subtle approach, providing aid and diplomatic support to their preferred partner. Militarily, Turkey and Egypt have gone the farthest by approving troop deployments, though Russia also has a presence through the Wagner Group, and the UAE has conducted airstrikes for Haftar.

The GNA declared a state of emergency in Libya’s capital city of Tripoli in September 2018, less than a week after a UN cease-fire went into effect. Attempts to create a unity government failed as the HoR and the GNA continued to compete for power. Both governing bodies created their own central banks [PDF] and consolidated control over oil fields. In May 2018, French President Emmanuel Macron convened a meeting between Haftar, GNA leader Fayez Seraj, and parliamentary leaders to discuss ending the conflict and future elections. Though the rival groups agreed to hold elections in December 2018, UN Special Envoy to Libya Ghassan Salame said elections would be postponed until spring 2019.

Meanwhile, rival armed groups, including militias loyal to Haftar and the GNA’s security forces, continued fighting over access to and control of Libya’s National Oil Corporation (NOC) and regional oil fields. In December 2018, the NOC closed Libya’s largest oil field, El Sharara, due to security concerns; Haftar later declared the field secure and ready to restart operations but cut off all oil fields when fighting resumed.

On April 3, 2019, Haftar upended peace efforts by launching a campaign to take western Libya and Tripoli with the backing of Egypt, the UAE, France, and Russia. Haftar’s LNA made fast progress until stalling on the outskirts of Tripoli, achieving only small gains over the next year. At the GNA’s request, Turkey sent troops to Tripoli in early 2020 to reinforce the city’s defense and increase the size of the force ahead of the GNA counteroffensive. Meanwhile, the UAE conducted airstrikes in support of Haftar. UN-led mediation efforts made little progress [PDF] as the war escalated and civilian casualties rose through May 2020. With Turkish support, the GNA-aligned forces achieved a breakthrough in June, pushing the LNA back to Sirte. Tensions escalated when Egypt warned that Sirte was its “red line,” and in July, authorized the deployment of troops to help prevent the GNA from taking the city.

In August 2020, violence eased as the GNA declared a unilateral cease-fire. Haftar ended an oil blockade shortly after, paving the way for a nationwide cease-fire signed in October. The 2020 cease-fire established the 5+5 Joint Military Commission (JMC), comprised of officers from the GNA and LNA, to work on implementing the cease-fire and other security issues. The JMC made progress, but it has struggled to achieve the withdrawal of foreign fighters. Most importantly, despite a lack of trust and a faltering cease-fire, levels of violence remained low following the 2020 truce, allowing for a reopening of political dialogue.

Improved security allowed Libya to hold its first vote in five years in May 2019, but turnout totaled only 38 percent across the nine municipalities where local elections occurred. Dozens of other municipalities held staggered elections from 2019 to 2021, delayed by violence and the pandemic. UN-led talks also established a roadmap for parliamentary and presidential elections to be held on December 24, 2021. As part of this plan, the Libyan Political Dialogue Forum (LPDF) formed a provisional government, the Government of National Unity (GNU), in March 2021 to unify the GNA and HoR in preparation for national elections. The LPDF appointed Abdulhamid al-Dbeibah as prime minister and Mohamed al-Menfi, representing the eastern faction, president. The HoR almost unanimously approved the new government’s cabinet, and Seraj’s GNA and the eastern-based parliament ceded power to the new GNU.

On September 21, 2021, the HoR dashed hopes of elections when it passed a no-confidence motion against the GNU. Dbeibah called on Libyans to protest the HoR decision and reneged on his promise not to run in the election, declaring his candidacy along with Haftar and Qaddafi’s son, the other prominent candidates. However, the High National Electoral Commission indefinitely postponed the election just days before the planned vote as tensions arose over candidate eligibility and presidential and parliamentary powers. The HoR called for the dissolution of the GNU, arguing its mandate expired on December 24, but Dbeibah refused to step down and said his government would remain in place until elections are held. In March 2022, the HoR approved a new cabinet with Fathi Bashagha as prime minister, effectively setting up a rival government based in Sirte.

The formation of rival governments reignited struggles for control over territory and resources. In March 2022, Haftar’s forces seized the GNU Benghazi headquarters and cut off access to oil and gas fields to deprive the GNU of revenue since it refused to give Bashagha access to state funds for his government’s budget. With no prospect of a political solution and the HoR facing protests, Bashagha entered Tripoli and tried to install his government. He failed, and fighting broke out in the capital between rival government forces in August following months of skirmishes.

Recent Developments

Conditions improved in late 2022, but tensions remained high as the HoR solidified its institutions and political negotiations fractured. As UN-led talks failed to gain traction, the HoR embarked on its own path, passing a constitutional amendment in March 2023 that could lay the ground for elections and proposing to appoint a new national executive committee to replace the GNC and HoR.

The HoR has also engaged in talks with the High State Council (HSC), a committee established in 2015 to advise the GNA and HoR, forming a 6+6 joint council to create a roadmap for elections. In June 2023, that body recommended forming a new interim government in preparation for elections. While Haftar said he supports the proposal, Dbeibah, who has consolidated power after two years at the helm in Tripoli, rebuked any effort to form a new transitional governing body, insisting his government will continue to serve as the “interim” government until elections.

Dbeibah’s nephew and Haftar’s son have engaged in direct talks in Egypt on a separate plan to see Dbeibah stay in power but concede some ministries to Haftar. Those talks follow the May 2023 replacement of Bashagha with finance minister Osama Hamad as the eastern-based prime minister. The various peace talk tracks have each seen some progress, but low-scale violence persists, and any deal that does not have strong support from Dbeibah and Haftar is likely to cause further polarization.

Complicating peace prospects, Libya has also been drawn back into regional disputes over oil deposits and arms deals. In October 2022, the GNA signed an agreement with Turkey to begin oil and gas exploration off its coast, and in January 2023, it signed a deal with Italian company ENI to increase oil and gas output. Greece and Egypt have disputed maritime borders with Libya and condemned Turkey’s moves, raising the possibility of confrontation in the Mediterranean. To the dismay of the GNU, a Libyan court suspended the deal with Turkey in January 2023. A member of the Organization for Petroleum Exporting Companies (OPEC), Libya’s oil revenues constitute more than 80 percent of its total exports. As armed groups continue to fight over oil fields and restrict production, concerns have also increased over whether the country can support itself economically.

Leftover weaponry from prior conflicts has turned Libya into an “open supermarket” for arms, according to the former head of the UN Support Mission in Libya, which has fueled both internal political struggles and neighboring conflicts. Haftar has been accused of supplying weapons to the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in Sudan’s civil war, putting Haftar on the opposing side of his ally Egypt in that conflict.

On September 10, 2023, Storm Daniel hit northeastern Libya, triggering catastrophic flooding. More than eleven thousand people were reported dead, with many more missing in the port city of Derna, where the flooding caused nearby dams to burst. The country’s political turmoil hampered rescue efforts and the delivery of humanitarian aid, prompting hundreds of protestors in Derna to demand government accountability. As the hope for locating survivors diminished, relief efforts turned to tackle the worsening humanitarian crisis with more than forty thousand Libyans displaced, mounting medical supply shortages, and contaminated drinking water, raising fears of possible disease outbreaks.

Migration issues also continue to present grave humanitarian concerns. Libya’s porous borders and fractured security situation make it a top transit country for people trying to reach Europe, with smugglers sending migrants across the Mediterranean in unsafe, overcrowded vessels. The business has contributed to the nearly thirty thousand people who have died or disappeared crossing the sea since 2014. In 2023, the number of deaths and disappearances on the Central Mediterranean route increased compared to the previous five years. According to the UN, Libyan forces have also committed significant human rights abuses against migrants detained in Libyan facilities, including forced labor, extortion, torture, and sexual assault. A mass grave containing the bodies of sixty-five migrants was discovered in March 2024, leading the UN human rights chief to launch a full investigation. Meanwhile, the sex and labor trafficking of migrants and asylum-seekers at the hands of criminal networks, militia groups, government officials, and private employers remains largely unchecked.",Center For Preventive Action,https://microsites-live-backend.cfr.org/cdn/ff/HroaV0oKojAF93UG5mU5c23D2auVKebSNj9PNXPNiYU/1615823484/public/2019-07/RTS5V4X_Libya.jpg
Libyan civil war (2014–2020),Published date not found (newspaper3k),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libyan_civil_war_(2014%E2%80%932020),"Armed conflict in Libya

This article is about the conflict from 2014 to 2020. For the 8-month civil war in 2011, see Libyan civil war (2011)

The Libyan Civil War (2014–2020), also known as the Second Libyan Civil War, was a multilateral civil war which was fought in Libya among a number of armed groups, but mainly the House of Representatives (HoR) and the Government of National Accord (GNA), for six years from 2014 to 2020.[124]

The General National Congress (GNC), based in western Libya and backed by various militias with some support from Qatar and Turkey,[125][126][127][128][excessive citations] initially accepted the results of the 2014 election, but rejected them after the Supreme Constitutional Court nullified an amendment regarding the roadmap for Libya's transition and HoR elections.[13] The House of Representatives (or Council of Deputies) is in control of eastern and central Libya and has the loyalty of the Libyan National Army (LNA), and has been supported by airstrikes by Egypt and the UAE.[125] Due to controversy about constitutional amendments, HoR refused to take office from GNC in Tripoli,[129] which was controlled by armed Islamist groups from Misrata. Instead, HoR established its parliament in Tobruk, which is controlled by General Haftar's forces. In December 2015, the Libyan Political Agreement[130] was signed after talks in Skhirat, as the result of protracted negotiations between rival political camps based in Tripoli, Tobruk, and elsewhere which agreed to unite as the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA). On 30 March 2016, Fayez Sarraj, the head of GNA, arrived in Tripoli and began working from there despite opposition from GNC.[131]

In addition to those three factions, there are: the Islamist Shura Council of Benghazi Revolutionaries, led by Ansar al-Sharia, which had the support of the GNC and was defeated in Benghazi in 2017;[132][133][134] the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant's (ISIL's) Libyan provinces;[135] the Shura Council of Mujahideen in Derna which expelled ISIL from Derna in July 2015 and was later itself defeated in Derna by the Tobruk government in 2018;[136] as well as other armed groups and militias whose allegiances often change.[125]

In May 2016, GNA and GNC launched a joint offensive to capture areas in and around Sirte from ISIL. This offensive resulted in ISIL losing control of all significant territories previously held in Libya.[137][138] Later in 2016, forces loyal to Khalifa al-Ghawil attempted a coup d'état against Fayez al-Sarraj and the Presidential Council of GNA.[139]

On 4 April 2019, Khalifa Haftar, the commander of the Libyan National Army, called on his military forces to advance on Tripoli, the capital of the GNA, in the 2019–20 Western Libya campaign[140] This was met with reproach from United Nations Secretary General António Guterres and the United Nations Security Council.[141][142]

On 23 October 2020, the 5+5 Joint Libyan Military Commission representing the LNA and the GNA reached a ""permanent ceasefire agreement in all areas of Libya"". The agreement, effective immediately, required that all foreign fighters leave Libya within three months while a joint police force would patrol disputed areas. The first commercial flight between Tripoli and Benghazi took place that same day.[143][144] On 10 March 2021, an interim unity government was formed, which was slated to remain in place until the next Libyan presidential election scheduled for 24 December that year.[108] However, the election has been delayed several times[145][146][147] since, effectively rendering the unity government in power indefinitely, causing tensions which threaten to reignite the war.[66][67][34][28]

Background of discontent with General National Congress [ edit ]

At the beginning of 2014, Libya was governed by the General National Congress (GNC), which won the popular vote in 2012 elections. The GNC was made of two major political groups, the National Forces Alliance (NFC) and the Justice and Construction Party (JCP). The two major groups in parliament had failed to reach political compromises on the larger more important issues that the GNC faced.

Division among these parties, the row over the political isolation law, and a continuous unstable security situation greatly impacted the GNC's ability to deliver real progress towards a new constitution for Libya which was a primary task for this governing body.[148]

The GNC also included members associated with conservative Islamist groups as well as revolutionary groups (thuwwar). Some members of the GNC had a conflict of interest due to associations with militias and were accused of channeling government funds towards armed groups and allowing others to conduct assassinations and kidnappings. Parties holding majority of seats and some holding minority of seats began to use boycotts or threats of boycotts which increased division and suppressed relevant debates by removing them from the congressional agenda;[149] voting to declare sharia law and establishing a special committee to ""review all existing laws to guarantee they comply with Islamic law"";[150] imposing gender segregation and compulsory hijab at Libyan universities; and refusing to hold new elections when its electoral mandate expired in January 2014[151] until General Khalifa Haftar launched a large-scale military offensive against the Islamists in May 2014, code-named Operation Dignity (Arabic: عملية الكرامة; 'Amaliyat al-Karamah).[152][153]

Political fragmentation of the GNC [ edit ]

The 2012 elections, overseen by the Libyan electoral commission with the support of the UN Special Mission In Libya (UNSMIL) and nongovernmental organizations like the International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES), have been considered ""fair and free"" by most Libyans. However, the elections did not necessarily create a strong government because the Parliament was fragmented due to the lack of organized political parties in Libya post-revolution. The GNC was made up of two major parties, the National Forces Alliance and the Justice and Construction Party, as well as independents in which some were moderates and other conservative Islamists. The GNC became a broad-based congress.[148]

The GNA elected Nouri Abusahmain as president of the GNC in June 2013.[154][155] He was considered an independent Islamist and a compromise candidate acceptable to liberal members of the congress, as he was elected with 96 out of a total of 184 votes by the GNC.[156]

Libya Revolutionaries Operations Room and kidnapping of Ali Zeidan [ edit ]

The GNC was challenged due to increasing security concerns in Tripoli. The GNC itself was attacked many times by militias and armed protesters who stormed the GNC assembly hall.[157] Following his appointment, Abusahmain was tasked with providing security. He set up the Libya Revolutionaries Operations Room (LROR), which was made up of rebels from Gharyan, and was initially intended to protect and secure Tripoli in August 2013. Its commander was Adel Gharyani. During this time, Abusahmain blocked inquiries into the distribution of state funds and it was alleged that Abusahmain was channeling government funding towards the LROR.[156]

In October, Libyan Prime Minister Ali Zeidan was kidnapped. It is believed to have been carried out by the LROR,[158] although there is evidence to suggest that armed groups such as the Duru3 actually conducted the kidnapping.[159] Following the kidnapping, Abusahmain used his presidency to change the agenda of the GNC in order to prevent them from disestablishing the LROR. At the same time, he cancelled a request to establish a committee to investigate his allocation of 900 million Libyan Dinars (US$720 million) to the LROR and various other armed groups.[149]

The GNC responded by removing Abusahmain as president and dismissing the LROR from its security function.[160] However, the armed group was allowed to continue to operate, and no one was prosecuted for the incident.

Expansion of armed groups during the GNC's term [ edit ]

Many Libyans blamed the GNC and the interim government for a continued lack of security in the country. The interim government struggled to control well-armed militias and armed groups that established during the revolution. Libyans in Benghazi especially began to witness assassinations and kidnapping and perceived the GNC to be turning a blind eye to the deteriorating security situation in the east.

But security concerns increased across the country, allowing armed groups to expand in Tripoli and the east.

In 2012, the assassination of the US ambassador to Libya by Ansar al-Sharia took place. [ 161 ]

In October 2013, the kidnapping of Prime Minister Ali Zeidan by the LROR took place.

The kidnapping of Egyptian diplomats in January 2014 also by the LROR took place.

In March 2014, armed protesters allegedly linked to the LROR stormed the GNC parliament building, shooting and injuring two lawmakers and wounding several others. [ 157 ]

In April 2014, an anti-terrorist training base called ""Camp 27"", located between Tripoli and the Tunisian border, was taken over by forces fighting under the control of Abd al-Muhsin Al-Libi, also known as Ibrahim Tantoush,[162] a long-serving Al-Qaeda organizer and former member of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group.[163] The Islamist forces at Camp 27 have subsequently been described as part of the Libya Shield Force.[164] The Libya Shield Force was already identified by some observers as linked to al-Qaeda as early as 2012.[165][166]

GNC's political isolation law [ edit ]

Although Islamists were outnumbered by Liberals and Centrists in the GNC, in May 2013 they lobbied for a law ""banning virtually everyone who had participated in Gaddafi's government from holding public office"". While several Islamist political parties and independents supported the law, as they generally had no associations to the Gaddafi regime, the law enjoyed strong public support.

The law particularly impacts elite expatriates and leaders of liberal parties. There existed reservations that such a law would eliminate technocratic expertise needed in Libya at the time.

Armed militiamen stormed government ministries, shut down the GNC itself and demanded the law's passage. This intimidated the GNC into passing the law in which 164 members approved the bill, with only four abstaining and no member opposing it.[148]

Suppression of women's rights [ edit ]

GNC opponents argue that it was supporting Islamist actions against women. Sadiq Ghariani, the Grand Mufti of Libya, is perceived to be linked closely to Islamist parties. He has issued fatwas ordering Muslims to obey the GNC,[167] and fatwas ordering Muslims to fight against Haftar's forces[168]

In March 2013, Sadiq Ghariani, issued a fatwa against the UN Report on Violence Against Women and Girls. He condemned the UN report for ""advocating immorality and indecency in addition to rebelliousness against religion and clear objections to the laws contained in the Quran and Sunnah"".[169] Soon after the Grand Mufti issued a clarification op-ed that there should be no discrimination between men and women yet women have a greater role in the family.[170]

Later in 2013, lawyer Hamida Al-Hadi Al-Asfar, advocate of women's rights, was abducted, tortured and killed. It is alleged she was targeted for criticising the Grand Mufti's declaration.[171] No arrests were made.

In June 2013, two politicians, Ali Tekbali and Fathi Sager, appeared in court for ""insulting Islam"" for publishing a cartoon promoting women's rights.[172] Under sharia law they were facing a possible death penalty.[citation needed] The case caused widespread concern although they were eventually acquitted in March 2014. After the GNC was forced to accept new elections, Ali Tekbali was elected to the new House of Representatives.[citation needed]

Protesters stage a large demonstration in Shahat against the GNC's mandate extension plan. [ 152 ]

During Nouri Abusahmain's presidency of the GNC and subsequent to GNC's decision to enforce sharia law in December 2013, gender segregation and compulsory hijab were being imposed in Libyan universities from early 2014, provoking strong criticism from Women's Rights groups.

A Netherlands-based global advocacy organization, Cordaid, reported that violence against Libyan women at the hands of militias frequently goes unpunished. Cordaid also noted that restricted freedom of movement, driven by fear of violence, has led to declines in schooling among women and girls.[173]

The GNC failed to stand down at the end of its electoral mandate in January 2014, unilaterally voting on 23 December 2013 to extend its power for at least one year. This caused widespread unease and some protests. Residents of the eastern city of Shahat, along with protesters from Bayda and Sousse, staged a large demonstration, rejecting the GNC's extension plan and demanding the resignation of the congress followed by a peaceful power transition to a legitimate body. They also protested the lack of security, blaming the GNC for failing to build the army and police.[152] Other Libyans rejecting the proposed mandate rallied in Tripoli's Martyrs Square and outside Benghazi's Tibesti Hotel, calling for the freeze of political parties and the re-activation of the country's security system.[174]

On 14 February 2014, General Khalifa Haftar ordered the GNC to dissolve and called for the formation of a caretaker government committee to oversee new elections. However, his actions had little effect on the GNC, which called his actions ""an attempted coup"" and called Haftar himself ""ridiculous"" and labelled him an aspiring dictator. The GNC continued to operate as before. No arrests were made. Haftar launched Operation Dignity three months later on 16 May.[175]

House of Representatives versus GNC [ edit ]

Military situation in Libya in July 2015

On 25 May 2014, about one week after Khalifa Haftar started his ""Operation Dignity"" offensive against the General National Congress, that body set 25 June 2014 as the date for new elections.[176] Islamists were defeated, but rejected the results of the election, which saw only an 18% turnout.[177][178] They accused the new House of Representatives parliament of being dominated by supporters of Gaddafi, and they continued to support the old GNC after the Council officially replaced it on 4 August 2014.[125][179]

The conflict escalated on 13 July 2014, when Tripoli's Islamists and Misratan militias launched ""Operation Libya Dawn"" to seize Tripoli International Airport, capturing it from the Zintan militia on 23 August. Shortly thereafter, members of the GNC, who had rejected the June election, reconvened as a new General National Congress and voted themselves as replacement of the newly elected House of Representatives, with Tripoli as their political capital, Nouri Abusahmain as president and Omar al-Hasi as prime minister. As a consequence, the majority of the House of Representatives were forced to relocate to Tobruk, aligning themselves with Haftar's forces and eventually nominating him army chief.[180] On 6 November, the supreme court in Tripoli, dominated by the new GNC, declared the House of Representatives dissolved.[181][182] The House of Representatives rejected this ruling as made ""under threat"".[183]

On 16 January 2015, the Operation Dignity and Operation Libya Dawn factions agreed on a ceasefire.[184] The country was then led by two separate governments, with Tripoli and Misrata controlled by forces loyal to Libya Dawn and the new GNC in Tripoli, while the international community recognized Abdullah al-Thani's government and its parliament in Tobruk.[185] Benghazi remained contested between pro-Haftar forces and radical Islamists.[186]

Opposing forces [ edit ]

The pro-GNC forces were a coalition of different militias with different ideologies although most of them are Islamist influenced especially in eastern Libya in Benghazi and Derna. Since LPA negotiations started in Skhirat there has been a rift within the militias over support for the UN-sponsored talks and the proposed Government of National Accord, which seeks to unite the rival governments.[187]

Since GNA started working from Tripoli in March 2015, Libya Dawn coalition the largest of Pro-GNC militias has been disbanded and most of its forces changed allegiances to GNA.[188]

Libya Dawn [ edit ]

The Islamist ""Libya Dawn"" has been described as ""an uneasy coalition"" identified as ""terrorists"" by the elected parliament in Tobruk[189] including ""former al-Qaeda jihadists"" who fought against Gaddafi in the 1990s, members of Libya's branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, and a ""network of conservative merchants"" from Misrata, whose fighters make up ""the largest block of Libya Dawn's forces"".[190] The coalition was formed in 2014 as a reaction against General Khalifa Haftar failed coup and to defeat Zintan brigades controlling Tripoli International Airport whose aligned with him.

The Zawia tribe has been allied to Libya Dawn since August 2014,[191] although in June 2014 at least one Zawia army unit had appeared to side with General Haftar, and reports in December claimed Zawia forces were openly considering breaking away from Libya Dawn.[192] Zawia militia have been heavily fighting the Warshefana tribe. In the current conflict, the Warshefana have been strongly identified with the forces fighting against both Libya Dawn and Al Qaeda. Zawia has been involved in a long-standing tribal conflict with the neighbouring Warshefana tribe since 2011.[193] The motivations of the Zawia brigades participation in the war have been described as unrelated to religion and instead deriving foremost from tribal conflict with the Warshafana and secondarily as a result of opposition to the Zintani brigades and General Haftar.[194]

When the head of GNA Fayez Sarraj arrived in Tripoli, Libya Dawn has been disbanded as the interests of the militias forming it conflicted when some of them choose to support GNA others chose to stay loyal to GNC.

Libya Shield [ edit ]

The Libya Shield Force supports the Islamists. Its forces are divided geographically, into the Western Shield, Central Shield and Eastern Shield. Elements of the Libya Shield Force were identified by some observers as linked to Al-Qaeda as early as 2012.[165][166] The term ""Libya Shield 1"" is used to refer to the Islamist part of the Libya Shield Force in the east of Libya.[195]

In western Libya, the prominent Islamist forces are the Central Shield (of the Libya Shield Force), which consists especially of Misrata units and the Libya Revolutionaries Operations Room. Two smaller organizations operating in western Libya are Ignewa Al-Kikly and the ""Lions of Monotheism"".

Al-Qaeda leader Abd al-Muhsin Al-Libi, also known as Ibrahim Ali Abu Bakr or Ibrahim Tantoush[163] has been active in western Libya, capturing the special forces base called Camp 27 in April 2014 and losing it to anti-Islamist forces in August 2014.[162] The Islamist forces around Camp 27 have been described as both Al-Qaida[162] and as part of the Libya Shield Force.[164] The relationship between Al-Qaeda and Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb is unclear, and their relationship with other Libyan Islamist groups is unclear. Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb are also active in Fezzan, especially in border areas.

Libya western and central Libya Shield force fought alongside Libya Dawn and were disbanded with it in 2015. While the eastern Libya Shield forces merged later with other Islamist militias and formed Revolutionary Shura Council to fight Hafter LNA.

Revolutionary Shura Councils [ edit ]

In Benghazi, the Islamist armed groups have organized themselves into the Shura Council of Benghazi Revolutionaries. These include:

The Shura Council of Benghazi has been strongly linked with ISIL as they fought together against Hafter in Battle of Benghazi. However, the Shura Council never pledged allegiance to ISIL.[187]

Meanwhile, in Derna the main Islamist coalition Shura Council of Mujahideen which was formed in 2014 is an al-Qaeda-affiliated group. The coalition has been in fight with ISIL in 2015 and drove them out from the city.[187]

Ajdabiya had its own Shura Council of Benghazi Revolutionaries, which is the most ISIL linked among the three Shura councils. Its leader Muhammad al-Zawi and a number of the council pledging allegiance to ISIL played a major role in strengthening the Islamist group grip on Sirte.[187]

Benghazi Defense Brigades [ edit ]

Benghazi Defense Brigades was formed in June 2016 to defend Benghazi and the Shura Council from the Libyan National Army, the Benghazi Defence Brigades (BDB) included various Libya Dawn militias and was organized under the banner of the former Grand mufti Saddiq Al-Ghariyani.[196][197] Even though it pledged to support the GNA[197] and apparently working under Mahdi Al-Barghathi, the Defence Minister of the GNA.[198] The GNA never recognized the BDB with some members calling for it to be demarcated as a ""terrorist organization"".[199]

Amazigh militias [ edit ]

Even though the Amazigh militias mainly situated in Zuwara and Nafusa Mountains fought alongside Libya Dawn, they consider themselves pushed towards that because Zintan brigades and the rest of their enemies has been sided with HoR.[200] Still though, the Amazigh main motivations for fighting against Haftar is his Pan-Arabic ideas which is conflicting with their demands of recognition their language in the constitution as an official language.

While keeping their enmity towards Haftar, the Amazigh militias mostly became neutral later in the war especially since the formation of GNA.

Operation Dignity [ edit ]

The anti-Islamist Operation Dignity forces are built around Haftar's faction of the Libyan National Army, including land, sea and air forces along with supporting local militias.

LNA [ edit ]

The Libyan National Army, formally known as ""Libyan Arab Armed Forces"", was gradually formed by General Khalifa Haftar as he fought in what he named Operation Dignity. On 19 May 2014, a number of Libyan military officers announced their support for Gen. Haftar, including officers in an air force base in Tobruk, and others who have occupied a significant portion of the country's oil infrastructure, as well as members of an important militia group in Benghazi. Haftar then managed to gather allies from Bayda, 125 miles east of Benghazi.[201] A minority portion of the Libya Shield Force had been reported to not have joined the Islamist forces, and it is not clear if this means they had joined the LNA forces.[202]

Since then Haftar continued to strengthen his LNA by recruiting new soldiers along with the advancements he made on the ground. In 2017 Haftar said that his forces are now larger by ""hundred times"" and now they are about 60 thousand soldiers.[203]

Salafist militias [ edit ]

Salafists, called Madkhalis by their enemies, fought alongside Haftar LNA since the beginning against the Islamist militias, especially Shura Council of Benghazi Revolutionaries and IS whom they considered Khawarij after a fatwa from Saudi Rabee al-Madkhali.[204]

Zintan brigades [ edit ]

Since the Battle of Tripoli Airport, armed groups associated with Zintan and the surrounding Nafusa region have become prominent. The Airport Security Battalion is recruited in large part from Zintan. The ""Zintan Brigades"" fall under the leadership of the Zintan Revolutionaries' Military Council.

Wershefana militias [ edit ]

Wershefana tribal and mainly Gaddafi loyalists armed groups, from the area immediately south and west of Tripoli, have been active in and among Haftar forces west of Libya.

On 5 August 2014, Warshefana forces captured Camp 27, a training base west of Tripoli.[164] Wershefana armed groups have also been involved in a tribal conflict with the neighbouring Zawia city since 2011.[193] Zawia has allied with Libya Dawn since August 2014,[191] although its commitment to Libya Dawn is reportedly wavering.[192]

After being accused of kidnapping, ransoming and other crimes, a GNA joint force made up mostly from Zintan brigades seized the Wershefana district.[205]

Kaniyat militia [ edit ]

Since the 2011 Libyan uprising against Muammar Gaddafi, the Kaniyat militiamen dominated and brutalized the civilians in Tarhuna to deepen their control over the strategic city. Formed by the Kani brothers, the militia committed atrocities that became known in 2017. The militia allied with the Government of National Accord (GNA) in 2016, which considered the Kaniyat important for their control over the 7th Brigade, gateway to Tripoli from south Libya. Human rights activists and the residents said the GNA and the UN provided political support to the militia and ""chose not to see"" the abuses and killings.[206]

In 2019, the Kaniyat militia aligned with the UAE-backed Khalifa Haftar and put their fighters under the general's 9th Brigade. Following that, the killings and disappearances in Tarhuna amplified. Over a decade until 2021, over 1,000 civilians were killed by the Kaniyat militia, where nearly 650 were killed in 14 months under Haftar. In 2020, the GNA forces successfully ousted the militia and the UAE-backed Haftar's forces and captured Tarhuna. Survivors reported of being tortured, electrocuted and beaten by the militia. Around 120 bodies were recovered from the mass graves, of which only 59 were identified.[206]

Ethnic tensions [ edit ]

In 2014, a former Gaddafi officer reported to the New York Times that the civil war was now an ""ethnic struggle"" between Arab tribes (like the Zintanis) against those of Turkish ancestry (like the Misuratis), as well as against Berbers and Circassians.[207]

Effects [ edit ]

Libyan oil fields, pipelines, refineries and storage

As of February 2015, damage and disorder from the war has been considerable.[208] There are frequent electric outages, little business activity, and a loss in revenues from oil by 90%.[208] Over 5,700 people died from the fighting by the end of 2016,[119] and some sources claim nearly a third of the country's population has fled to Tunisia as refugees.[208]

Since Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar had captured the ports of Libya's state-run oil company, the National Oil Corporation, in Es Sider and Ra's Lanuf, oil production has risen from 220,000 barrels a day to about 600,000 barrels per day.[209]

The war has prompted a considerable number of the country's sizeable foreign labour force to leave the country as extremist groups such as ISIL have targeted them; prior to the 2011, the Egyptian Ministry of Labour estimated that there were two million Egyptians working in the country yet since the escalation of attacks on Egyptian labourers the Egyptian Foreign Ministry estimates more than 800,000 Egyptians have left the country to return to Egypt.[210] Land mines remain a persistent threat in the country as numerous militias, especially ISIL, have made heavy use of land mines and other hidden explosives; the rapidly changing front lines has meant many of these devices remain in areas out of active combat zones; civilians remain the primary casualties inflicted by land mines with mines alone killing 145 people and wounding another 1,465 according to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).[211][212]

In a report, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) revealed that it had registered over 45,600 refugees and asylum seekers in Libya during 2019.[213] The World Food Programme reported that an estimated 435,000 people had been forcibly displaced from their homes during the conflict.[214]

On 22 October 2019, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) reported that children have been suffering from different sorts of malnutrition in the war-torn nations, including Libya.[215]

Executive Director of UNICEF said on 18 January 2020, that thousands of Libyan children were at risk of being killed due to the ongoing conflict in Libya. Since hostile clashes between the Libyan government and Haftar's LNA forces (backed by the UAE and Egypt) have broken out in Tripoli and western Libya, conditions of children and civilians have worsened.[216]

The blockade on Libya's major oil fields and production units by Haftar's forces has sown losses of over $255 million within the six-day period ending 23 January, according to the National Oil Corporation in Libya.[217] The NOC and ENI, which runs Mellitah Oil & Gas in Libya, have suffered a production loss of 155,000 oil barrels per day due to the blockade on production facilities imposed by Haftar's LNA. The entities claim losing revenue of around $9.4mn per day.[218]

Since the beginning of Libyan conflict, thousands of refugees forced to live in detention centres are suffering from mental health problems, especially women and children, who are struggling to confront the deaths of their family members in the war.[219]

On 7 February 2020, the UNHCR reported that the overall number of migrants intercepted by the Libyan coast guard in January surged 121% against the same period in 2019. The ongoing war has turned the country into a huge haven for migrants fleeing violence and poverty in Africa and the Middle East.[220]

On 6 April, an armed group invaded a control station in Shwerif, the Great Man-Made River project, stopped water from being pumped to Tripoli, and threatened the workers. The armed group's move was a way to pressure and force the release of the detained family members. On 10 April 2020, the United Nations humanitarian coordinator for Libya, Yacoub El Hillo condemned the water supply cutoff as ""particularly reprehensible"".[221]

On 21 April 2020, the UN took in to consideration the ""dramatic increase"" of shelling on densely populated areas of Tripoli, and claimed that continuation of war is worsening the humanitarian situation of Libya. The organisation also warned that such activities could possibly lead to war crimes.[222]

The United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) in its first quarter report for 2020 on the civilian casualty in Libya cited that approximately 131 casualties have taken place between 1 January and 31 March 2020. The figures included 64 deaths and 67 injuries, all of which were a result of the ground fighting, bombing and targeted killing led by Khalifa Haftar's army, the LNA, backed by the United Arab Emirates.[223][224]

On 5 May 2020, The International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda, raised concerns over the continuous spree of attacks by Haftar on Tripoli. The prosecutor said that actions endanger lives and warned of possible war crimes due to current affairs. ""Of particular concern to my Office are the high numbers of civilian casualties, largely reported to be resulting from airstrikes and shelling operations,"" she expressed in a statement.[225]

On 10 November 2020, prominent Libyan activist, Hanane al-Barassi, was killed in Benghazi. The 46-year-old Barassi was an outspoken critic of humanitarian abuses committed in the eastern areas controlled by UAE-backed Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA). She was known for giving voice to female victims of violence through the videos she posted on social media.[226]

Timeline [ edit ]

Peace process [ edit ]

During the first half of 2015, the United Nations facilitated a series of negotiations seeking to bring together the rival governments and warring militias of Libya.[227] A meeting between the rival governments was held at Auberge de Castille in Valletta, Malta on 16 December 2015. On 17 December, delegates from the two governments signed a peace deal backed by the UN in Skhirat, Morocco, although there was opposition to this within both factions.[1][2] The Government of National Accord was formed as a result of this agreement, and its first meeting took place in Tunis on 2 January 2016.[228] On 17 December 2017, general Khalifa Haftar declared the Skhirat agreement void.[229]

A meeting called the Libyan National Conference was planned in Ghadames for organising elections and a peace process in Libya.[230] The conference was prepared over 18 months during 2018 and 2019 and was planned to take place 14–16 April 2019.[231] It was postponed in early April 2019 as a result of the military actions of the 2019 Western Libya offensive.[232]

The Libya Summit in Berlin, Germany on 19 January 2020

In July 2019, Ghassan Salamé, the head of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL), proposed a three-point peace plan (a truce during Eid al-Adha, an international meeting of countries implicated in the conflict, and an internal Libyan conference similar to the Libyan National Conference).[233]

In September 2019, the Peace and Security Council (PSC) of the African Union (AU) discussed the need for the PSC to play a greater role in concluding the Libyan crisis, putting forward a proposal to appoint a joint AU-UN envoy to Libya.[234]

Turkish President RT Erdogan and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin made a joint call for ceasefire, starting 12 January 2020, to end the proxy war in Libya.[235] The ceasefire is said to have been broken hours after its initiation. Both the warring parties – GNA supported by Turkey and LNA backed by Saudi, UAE, Egypt and Jordan – blamed each other for the violence that broke out in Tripoli.[236] Turkey's Foreign Minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu said Khalifa Haftar, who is backed by foreign powers including the UAE, does not want peace and is seeking a military solution to the drawn-out war in the country.[237]

Haftar's forces launched attacks on Abu Gurain province, near the port city of Misurata, Libya's UN-recognized government claimed. The attacks were seen as a violation of cease-fire accord signed at the Berlin Conference.[238] On 12 February, the United Nations Security Council adopted a resolution demanding a ""lasting cease-fire"" in Libya. Drafted by Britain, it received 14 votes, while Russia abstained.[239] Around 19 February, the government withdrew from peace talks following rocket attacks on Tripoli.[240]

At the urging of the UN, both sides agreed to a new ceasefire in late March due to the novel coronavirus; however, the ceasefire quickly fell apart. On 24 March shells hit a prison in an area held by the GNA, drawing UN condemnation. The GNA launched a series of ""counter-attacks"" early on 25 March, in response to what the GNA called ""the heaviest bombardments Tripoli has seen"".[241] In June 2020, Egyptian president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi brokered an agreement with parties aligned to the Libyan National Army, calling it the Cairo Declaration – However, this was quickly rejected.[242]

On 21 August 2020, Libya's rival authorities announced an immediate ceasefire. The Tripoli-based and internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) published a statement that also calls for elections in March 2021.[243][244]

The United Nations Security Council received a confidential report in September 2020, which provided details of the extensive violations of the international arms embargo on Libya, since the beginning of 2020. The UN identified eight countries breaching embargo. Besides, the United Arab Emirates and Russia were found to have sent five cargo aircraft filled with weapons to Libya on 19 January 2020, when the world leaders were signing a pledge to respect the arms embargo on Libya, at the Berlin conference. Four out of the five cargo airplanes belonged to the UAE.[245]

On 16 September 2020, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu told CNN Turk that Turkey and Russia have moved closer to an agreement on a ceasefire and political process in Libya during their latest meetings in Ankara. According to Reuters, Turkey and Russia were the main power brokers in the Libyan war, backing opposing sides. Russia supported the eastern-based forces of Khalifa Haftar, while Turkey backed Libya's internationally recognised Government of National Accord.[246]

In September 2020, the European Union issued sanctions against two people, who were indirectly or directly engaged in serious human rights abuses. While Benghazi-based Mahmoud al-Werfalli was engaged in violations like killings and executions, Moussa Diab was involved in human trafficking and the kidnapping, raping and killing of migrants and refugees. Three companies, Turkish maritime firm Avrasya Shipping, Jordan-based Med Wave Shipping and a Kazakhstan-based air freight company, Sigma Airlines, were also sanctioned for breaching the UN arms embargo by transferring military material to Libya.[247] Among these, Sigma Airlines was also found involved in the air-borne hard cash shipments for the Khalifa Haftar's government from the United Arab Emirates, Russia and the United Kingdom, among others. Sigma Airlines was also involved in a bank-note delivery made on 29 January 2019 for the LNA, using a commercial network operating through the UAE, Ukraine, Jordan and Belarus. In approximately $227 million bank note transfers, $91 million came from the UK, $27 million from Russia and $5 million from the UAE, which recorded highest number of transfers among 14 countries that were involved.[248][249]

On 23 October 2020, the 5+5 Joint Libyan Military Commission representing the LNA and the GNA reached a ""permanent ceasefire agreement in all areas of Libya"". The agreement, effective immediately, required that all foreign fighters leave Libya within three months while a joint police force would patrol disputed areas. The first commercial flight between Tripoli and Benghazi took place that same day.[143][144] The war concluded on 24 October 2020.[250]

UN-sponsored peace talks failed to establish an interim government by 16 November 2020, although both sides pledged to try again in a week.[251]

Talks by the Advisory Committee of the Libya Political Dialogue Forum (LPDF) in Geneva during 13–16 January 2021 produced a proposal for a procedure for selecting a unified executive authority. On 18 January, 72 of the LPDF members participated in a vote on the proposal. The proposal passed, attaining more than the 63% decision threshold, with 51 voters in favour, 19 against, 2 abstentions and 2 absences. The validated electoral procedure involves electoral colleges, support from the West, East and South of Libya, a 60% initial threshold, and a 50% plus one second-round threshold, for positions in the Presidency Council and for the prime ministership.[252][253]

On 19 February 2021, a confidential report by the United Nations revealed that the former CEO of Blackwater, Erik Prince breached the Libyan arms embargo by supporting and supplying weapons to Khalifa Haftar under an operation that cost $80 million. In 2019, Prince deployed foreign mercenaries to eastern Libya, who were armed with gunboats, attack aircraft, and cyberwarfare capabilities. While the report didn't conclude who funded the mercenary operation, analysts and Western officials asserted that it was most likely the UAE. The report noted that the mercenaries had offices, shell companies, and bank accounts in the Gulf nation.[254]

The FBI also opened an investigation into the failed mercenary plot of 2019. The agency was also looking into determining the role of Erik Prince in the attempted sale of aircraft and other materiel from Jordan to the UAE-backed Khalifa Haftar. Previous reports have highlighted that a Jordanian royal Feisal Ibn al-Hussein worked with Prince to organize the weapons transfer to Libya. However, the Jordanian government had aborted the sale.[255] Following which, Prince organized a meeting between his business associate Christiaan Durrant and a member of Donald Trump's National Security Council. During the meeting, Durrant explained Prince's Libyan campaign plan backing Haftar to the NSC official and asked for the US' support.[256] A UN report also revealed that three aircraft controlled or owned by Prince were transferred to a mercenary firm connected to him and located in the United Arab Emirates. However, Prince was not charged with a crime.[255]

Reactions [ edit ]

Domestic reactions [ edit ]

Khalifa Haftar and his supporters describe Operation Dignity as a ""correction to the path of the revolution"" and a ""war on terrorism"".[257][258][259] The elected parliament has declared that Haftar's enemies are ""terrorists"".[189] Opponents of Haftar and the House of Representatives' government in Tripoli claim he is attempting a coup. Omar al-Hasi, the internationally unrecognized Prime Minister of the Libya Dawn-backed Tripoli government, speaking of his allies' actions, has stated that: ""This is a correction of the revolution."" He has also contended: ""Our revolution had fallen into a trap.""[260] Dawn commanders claim to be fighting for a ""revolutionary"" cause rather than for religious or partisan objectives.[261] Islamist militia group Ansar al-Sharia (linked to the 2012 Benghazi attack) has denounced Haftar's campaign as a Western-backed ""war on Islam""[262] and has declared the establishment of the ""Islamic Emirate of Benghazi"".

The National Oil Corporation (NOC) denounced calls to blockade oil fields prior to the Berlin Conference on 19 January 2020, calling it a criminal act. The entity warned to prosecute offenders to the highest degree under Libyan and international law.[263]

Dignitaries from Tripoli, Sahel and Mountain regions in Libya expressed discomposure at the UN envoy's briefing to Libya, Ghassan Salame at the Security Council, for equalizing the aggressors (Haftar's forces backed by UAE and Egypt) and the defender (GNA forces). They said Salame's statements made both the parties equal amid Haftar's offensive in Tripoli and the war crimes committed against civilians, including children.[264]

Libya: Most intense fighting for years rocks Tripoli,2025-05-14T00:00:00,https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/14/africa/intense-fighting-rocks-tripoli-intl,"Reuters —

The most intense clashes for years rocked Tripoli for a second night and continued into Wednesday morning, witnesses in the Libyan capital said, after Monday’s killing of a major militia leader set off fighting between rival factions.

The United Nations Libya mission UNSMIL said it was “deeply alarmed by the escalating violence in densely populated neighborhoods of Tripoli” and urgently called for a ceasefire.

The latest unrest in Libya’s capital could consolidate the power of Abdulhamid al-Dbeibah, prime minister of the divided country’s Government of National Unity (GNU) and an ally of Turkey.

Libya has had little stability since a 2011 NATO-backed uprising ousted longtime autocrat Muammar Gaddafi and the country split in 2014 between rival eastern and western factions, though an outbreak of major warfare paused with a truce in 2020.

A major energy exporter, Libya is also an important way station for migrants heading to Europe and its conflict has drawn in foreign powers including Turkey, Russia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. Its main oil facilities are located in southern and eastern Libya, far from the current fighting in Triopli.

While eastern Libya has been dominated for a decade by commander Khalifa Haftar and his Libyan National Army (LNA), control in Tripoli and western Libya has been splintered among numerous armed factions.

Dbeibah on Tuesday ordered the dismantling of what he called irregular armed groups.

That announcement followed Monday’s killing of major militia chief Abdulghani Kikli, widely known as Ghaniwa, and the sudden defeat of his Stabilization Support Apparatus (SSA) group by factions aligned with Dbeibah.

The seizure of SSA territory in Libya by the Dbeibah-allied factions, the 444 and 111 Brigades, indicated a major concentration of power in the fragmented capital, leaving the Special Deterrence Force (Rada) as the last big faction not closely tied to the prime minister.",Story Reuters,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2214267732.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill"

The United Nations has called for urgent de-escalation in Libya’s capital, Tripoli, as rival gunmen exchanged fire in the city’s southern districts after the killing of a powerful militia leader, with authorities imposing an emergency lockdown.

The appeal early on Tuesday came as residents reported hearing heavy gunfire and explosions across multiple neighbourhoods from about 9pm local time (19:00 GMT) on Monday.

Al Jazeera’s Malik Traina, reporting from Libya’s Misrata, said security sources had confirmed the killing of Abdel Ghani al-Kikli, widely known as “Gheniwa”, who is the head of the powerful Stability Support Authority (SSA) militia.

Gunfire and clashes then consumed several parts of Tripoli.

Al-Kikli was one of the capital’s most influential militia leaders and had recently been involved in disputes with rival armed groups, including factions linked to Misrata. His SSA is under the Presidential Council, which came to power in 2021 with the Government of National Unity (GNU) of Abdul Hamid Dbeibah through a UN-recognised process.

Traina said that at least six people have been wounded, although it remains unclear whether they are security force members or civilians.

In a statement shortly after the clashes began, the UN Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) said it was “alarmed by the unfolding security situation in Tripoli, with intense fighting with heavy weaponry in densely populated civilian areas”.

UNSMIL added that it “calls on all parties to immediately cease fighting and restore calm, and reminds all parties of their obligations to protect civilians at all times”.

UNSMIL voiced support for local mediation efforts, particularly those led by elders and community leaders, emphasising the need to protect civilians amid mounting tensions.

Schools shut, residents told to stay indoors

The GNU’s Ministry of Internal Affairs urged residents to stay home and avoid movement, warning of further instability, while the Ministry of Education suspended classes across Tripoli on Tuesday, citing the deteriorating security situation.

The GNU’s media platform said early on Tuesday that the Ministry of Defence had fully taken control of the Abu Salim neighbourhood.

“I heard heavy gunfire, and I saw red lights in the sky,” one resident told the Reuters news agency on condition of anonymity.

Two others told Reuters that the gunfire was echoing all over their neighbourhoods of Abu Salim and Salah Eddin.

Videos and images online showed plumes of black smoke amid the sound of gunfire, as well as armed men in the streets and convoys entering the city.

Footage verified by Al Jazeera’s Sanad fact-checking agency captured the sound of medium-calibre gunfire in several neighbourhoods, including areas where the SSA militia is known to operate.

Several districts have seen what local sources describe as “suspicious military manoeuvres”, with convoys arriving from Az-Zawiyah, Zintan and Misrata – seen by many as preparations for a possible showdown in the capital.

Al Jazeera’s Traina said the renewed clashes have prompted anger and worry.

“People are angry that every time these armed groups clash, civilians are caught in the crossfire,” he said, adding that residents are demanding “accountability”.

“When these groups fight and people are killed, no one is held responsible. Locals want justice, and expect the authorities to hold those behind the violence accountable,” he said.

TPLF says Ethiopia ban threatens Tigray peace deal,Published date not found (newspaper3k),https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxykqdlkego,"Tigray party says ban threatens Ethiopia peace deal

Delays in implementing the peace deal have sparked fears of fresh violence in Tigray

The decision follows months of political tensions in Tigray and comes ahead of nationwide elections that are due to take place by June next year at the latest.

The party, which governs Tigray and dominated the entire country for many years, was on Wednesday banned for failing to hold a general assembly.

The Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) has called for the African Union to mediate with the federal government after the electoral agency revoked its legal status as a party.

Ethiopia's main opposition party has condemned a ban on its activities, saying it posed a ""serious threat"" to the 2022 peace deal that ended two years of conflict in the northern Tigray region.

The party led a coalition that overthrew the government in 1991 and ruled Ethiopia until 2019 when it was dissolved a year after Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed had taken power.

He then formed a new national party, a move rejected by the TPLF.

The dispute culminated in a civil war that saw tens of thousands of people killed and millions forced from their homes in northern Ethiopia before a truce was signed in November 2022.

The party runs Tigray's interim administration which was established in 2023 as part of the peace deal, known as the Pretoria peace agreement.

But the party has been unable to conduct internal elections because of a split, with two factions laying claim to control of the party.

The National Election Board of Ethiopia, which supervises the conduct of political parties, on Wednesday ""resolved to formally deregister"" the TPLF on the grounds that it had failed to hold a general assembly.

But the party has protested against the move and called on the African Union to put ""pressure"" on the federal government to suspend the enforcement of the ban.

In a letter to the AU, the party said the ban ""denies the TPLF a right it had reclaimed through the Pretoria Agreement and poses a serious threat to the foundation of the peace process"".

It added that the peace deal stipulated that both parties recognise each other's legitimacy and any political issue should be resolved through dialogue.

TPLF deputy chairman Ammanuel Assefa told the BBC that the decision by the electoral board could ""damage the Pretoria agreement"" which ""is going to be dangerous"".

""This isn't just about TPLF, but also about undermining what people have sacrificed,"" Ammanuel added.

Delays in implementing the terms of the agreement, including the return of some one million people displaced by the war, have fuelled fears of fresh violence in Tigray.

Several countries including the US, UK and the European Union have warned about the escalating tension, saying there must be ""no return to violence"".

Power struggle leads to coup in Tigray as war looms between Ethiopia and Eritrea,2025-03-21T00:00:00,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/mar/21/tigray-mekelle-coup-war-ethiopia-eritrea-assab-port-abiy-ahmed,"Aregawi was building a tour-guiding business when war struck Ethiopia’s Tigray region in 2020. He spent the next two years fighting on the frontline. Now he is among those who fear Tigray is on the brink of conflict once more.

“We don’t want to become a battleground, but it seems like war is near, maybe even inevitable,” he said.

The war between Tigray’s rebellious rulers and Ethiopia’s federal government ended in 2022, leaving about 600,000 people dead and nearly 10% of women aged between 15 and 49 living in Tigray raped, according to a British Medical Journal study.

But the failure to implement most of the ceasefire’s provisions – including the return of nearly 1 million displaced people – and a scramble over resources has split the ruling Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) party.

Tensions escalated this month when Tigray’s interim president, Getachew Reda, tried to fire three senior military commanders, having previously accused his forces of attempting a coup.

A coup now appears to have taken place. Last week, a rival TPLF faction, led by the party chair Debretsion Gebremichael, installed its officials in provincial government offices. It also took over the mayor’s office and the main radio station in the regional capital, Mekelle. Getachew fled to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia’s capital.

On Saturday a skirmish in Tigray resulted in three deaths. A few days before, another person was killed during a dispute in the town of Adi Gudem.

All week long queues formed outside Tigray’s banks as people withdrew their cash, and flights out sold out. Armed men roamed Mekelle’s streets at night, checking people’s ID.

“Fear and uncertainty prevail,” said a resident, who asked not to be named. “My friends are planning to leave for Addis Ababa, Kenya and Uganda because of the fear of war.”

Against this backdrop, concerns are also increasing over tensions between Ethiopia and Eritrea. Despite fighting alongside each other in Tigray, the neighbouring countries have been at loggerheads for months over the determination of Ethiopia’s prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, to regain access to the Red Sea, which Ethiopia lost when Eritrea seceded in 1993.

Having previously made overtures to the breakaway republic of Somaliland, Abiy set his sights on Eritrea’s port of Assab. He has repeatedly said sea access was “existential” for Ethiopia, which with 130 million people is the world’s most populous landlocked country. He described losing Eritrea’s coastline as a “historical mistake”.

Eritrea has ordered a nationwide mobilisation and is trying to undermine Abiy by aiding rebels fighting Ethiopia’s military in the Amhara region bordering Tigray. There are reports that Eritrean intelligence helped Debretsion’s TPLF faction during last week’s coup.

Ethiopia has sent tanks and troops to the Eritrean border, and state media have been amplifying voices justifying Ethiopia’s claims over Assab port.

Last week, Gen Tsadkan Gebretensae, Tigray’s vice-president, warned that war could erupt “at any moment” and the region risked “becoming a battlefield” again.

Payton Knopf and Alexander Rondos, the former US and EU special envoys to the region, described developments as “dry tinder waiting for a match that could ignite an interstate war between Ethiopia and Eritrea”.

Abiy said he wanted Ethiopia to regain the port peacefully. “Ethiopia has no intention to invade Eritrea to gain Red Sea access,” he said on Thursday. “Our desire is to talk about it under the principle of give and take, in a mutually beneficial manner, and according to commercial law.”

He spoke after meeting the rival Tigray factions. It appears Abiy declined to intervene in support of Getachew, which could have sparked fresh fighting.

Abiy could seek a deal to secure the support of Tigray, which still has a formidable 200,000-strong military force.

Tigray’s new leaders, meanwhile, want to regain control of western Tigray, a fertile area with gold deposits that was seized by Amhara forces during the war. Any attempt to recapture it could also spark fresh conflict, said Ahmed Soliman, at the geopolitical thinktank Chatham House.

“The crux is how things evolve in Tigray and how Abiy responds,” Soliman said. “If there is no agreement, the situation could certainly escalate.”",Fred Harter,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0da3f5128286340b39f53879abd910151ff34b3f/0_275_4200_2520/master/4200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c926adfeba3ecc3db7391a9fb7a7c2a2
Resurging tensions in Ethiopia’s Tigray raise concerns of a new conflict,2025-03-25T00:00:00,https://www.vaticannews.va/en/world/news/2025-03/tensions-in-ethiopia-s-tigray-raise-concerns-of-a-new-conflict.html,"While the armed conflict in Tigray may have formally ceased in 2022, political instability continues to threaten the region’s fragile peace, with growing concerns that internal tensions could quickly spiral into a new regional conflict with the direct involvement of Eritrea.

By Lisa Zengarini

Despite the peace agreement, signed in Pretoria, South Africa, in 2022 between the Government of Ethiopia and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) ending the the two-year civil war in Ethiopia's Tigray, political instability continues to threaten peace in the region.

Escalating tensions over the leadership of Tigray’s transitional authority

The cause of the he latest tensions, which have been building up over the past year, is a power struggle within the TPLF itself, pitting its long-time leader, Debretsion Gebramichael, against his former deputy and the head of the Tigray Interim Administration (TIA), Getachew Reda.

The disagreement is largely centered on the implementation of the the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement (COHA), which was designed to reintegrate Tigray into Ethiopia’s federal structure. Debretsion has strongly criticized Getachew for what he perceives as the slow and ineffective enforcement of this agreement. He has not only called for the dissolution of the TIA but has actively sought to delegitimize Getachew’s authority.

Tensions reached a boiling point in mid-March when some members of the Tigray Defense Forces (TDF loyal to Debretsion seized key locations in Tigray, including the regional radio station and mayor’s office in Mekelle, as well as towns along the Eritrean border.

Getachew, in response, took decisive steps by suspending three TDF commanders and appealing for federal intervention. This escalation has heightened fears that northern Ethiopia could once again into full-scale war, possibly with the direct involvement of Eritrea.

Bishop Tesfaselassie Medhin of the Catholic Eparchy of Adigrat has voiced his concerns over these developments. Speaking to Fides Agency, he highlighted the devastating consequences another war would bring to a population that has already endured immense suffering.

The bishop also pointed to the dire humanitarian situation in Tigray which is further exacerbated by the sudden halt of USAID funding.

Humanitarian crisis further exacerbated by the sudden halt of USAID funding

This interruption, decided by US President Donald Trump, has severely affected crucial aid programmes run by NGOs, religious organizations, and government agencies. Catholic Relief Services the international humanitarian agency of the United States Catholic Church, which is one of the major providers of emergency food aid in Ethiopia, has had its operations suspended, with only limited private funding available for smaller initiatives. The lack of an alternative strategy to address these humanitarian needs further compounds the crisis, leaving millions of vulnerable people without support, inclusing those still internally displaced, who represent 15 percent of its population.

Church on the frontline to support the population in Tigray

Despite the overwhelming hardship, the Church continues to play a crucial role in providing both material aid and spiritual guidance to those affected. “ We are trying to move forward as a Church, to give hope to the people and be a sign of hope for them.” We Try to stand by their side and work for healing from the trauma of the war”.

Conflict in Ethiopia,Published date not found (newspaper3k),https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/conflict-ethiopia,"Tensions in Ethiopia’s Tigray region have escalated significantly, threatening to reignite conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea and destabilize the Horn of Africa. The Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) is embroiled in a power struggle with the Tigray Interim Administration (TIA), appointed by Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed in 2023 as part of the Pretoria Agreement that ended the civil war from 2020 to 2022. This internal division has led to violent clashes, with TPLF-aligned forces seizing control of key areas in Tigray. Eritrea is reportedly supporting these dissident factions of the TPLF, potentially undermining Ethiopia’s ambitions for sea access. The situation is further exacerbated by the incomplete implementation of the Pretoria Agreement, including the Tigray Defense Forces’ disarmament and the continued presence of Eritrean troops in Ethiopia. These developments have raised fears of a potential war between Ethiopia and Eritrea, which could have far-reaching consequences for regional stability and humanitarian conditions.

Background

Between 2020 and 2022, Ethiopia fought a war with militants from its northernmost region of Tigray, then under the control of the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front (TPLF). The conflict was one of the deadliest in recent history and drew international attention for alleged war crimes, human rights abuses, and ethnic cleansing. The war formally ended in November 2022, but Tigray was left in ruins, and its capital was turned over to the federal government.

For decades before the war, the TPLF was a dominant political force in Ethiopia. Between 1991 and his death in 2012, Tigrayan soldier-politician Meles Zenawi governed Ethiopia as an autocracy with the backing of a TPLF-dominated coalition. The Zenawi regime oversaw rapid development and increased Ethiopia’s international prominence, but his government marginalized ethnic groups, including the Oromo and Amhara, to solidify government power. Additionally, Ethiopia was at war with Eritrea [PDF] from 1998 to 2000. The war was followed by a nearly twenty-year-long frozen conflict, effectively paralyzing both countries politically and economically.

The TPLF continued to govern Ethiopia after Zenawi’s passing until 2018, when protests, especially among the Oromo population, prompted the government to appoint Abiy Ahmed Ali as the next prime minister. Abiy, born in Oromia, was heralded by international actors and Ethiopians as the country’s new hope for peace and ethnic harmony. Early in his premiership, he promised to heal broken trust between the country’s ethnic groups and began to roll back restrictions on certain political freedoms. In 2019, he received the Nobel Peace Prize for negotiating an end to Ethiopia’s two-decade standoff with Eritrea.

By 2020, ethnic relations within Ethiopia began to deteriorate once again. Repeated delays of long-promised national elections and the June 2020 extension of Abiy’s first term provoked indignation from the TPLF. The Tigray State Council’s decision to hold local elections in defiance of federal orders further inflamed tensions. These elections ultimately solidified the TPLF’s control over the region. On November 4, 2020, Abiy accused Tigrayan troops of attacking a federal military camp in the Tigrayan capital, Mekelle, and ordered Ethiopian National Defense Force (ENDF) troops to move north. This marked the beginning of a military campaign known as the Mekelle Offensive, which quickly escalated as the ENDF advanced deeper into Tigray, and the Tigray Defense Force, or TDF, ramped up their response.

Abiy initially framed the offensive as a targeted operation against TPLF leadership. A communications blackout at the outset of the conflict shuttered coverage of ground conditions. However, by December 2020, media and UN officials began sounding the alarm about the improper treatment of civilians, predominantly ethnic Tigrayans. Ethiopia’s neighbor and former adversary, Eritrea, intervened militarily on the side of the Ethiopian government. After months of denying their presence, Abiy admitted that Eritrean troops were fighting in Tigray in spring 2021.

In 2021, the United States characterized the war as an ethnic cleansing against Tigrayans, and some NGOs raised concerns about the potential of genocide. In March 2021, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights announced a joint probe with the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC) to investigate alleged abuses and rights violations in Tigray, although the impartiality and accuracy of the report [PDF] were called into question following its presentation at the United Nations.

Tigrayan forces retook the regional capital of Mekelle from the ENDF in June 2021. A month later, Addis Ababa announced the results of a national parliamentary election, which Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed won in a landslide. The TPLF boycotted the election, and opposition leadership in parliament accused the Abiy government of banning poll observers in some states. Later, in the summer of 2021, Abiy called on all capable citizens to join the war against Tigrayan forces as the conflict began to spill over into the Afar and Amhara regions, growing closer to Addis Ababa. In November 2021, Tigrayan troops and allied Oromo militants marched within eighty-five miles of the capital but were forced back north by ENDF forces.

The conflict divided Ethiopia along ethnic lines. Oromia’s regional army, the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA), allied itself with the TPLF, while militants from Amhara and Afar, regions bordering Tigray, sided with federal forces. In 2021, the government declared a state of emergency in Amhara after a series of attacks against ethnic Oromos. Similar bouts of ethnic violence occurred in Oromia, where local militants began attacking Amhara-majority enclaves in March 2021, forcing thousands to flee. As the war intensified, the attacks worsened. In June 2022, more than two hundred Amhara were murdered in Oromia. By July, several hundred had been killed in massacres across the region.

After a series of failed efforts to negotiate a settlement to the civil war, the TPLF and the Ethiopian central government signed a cessation of hostilities agreement on November 2, 2022, in Pretoria, South Africa. Followed by implementation negotiations in Nairobi, the agreement promised to disarm Tigrayan troops, hand control of Tigray to the Ethiopian federal government, end the Mekelle Offensive, and permit full humanitarian access to Tigray.

Notably, the Pretoria Agreement does not explicitly mention Eritrea, nor were Eritrean representatives present at the negotiations. This omission raised international concern that Eritrean troops would continue operations within Ethiopia despite the agreement between the Ethiopian government and TPLF. Indeed, displaced Tigrayans reported in January 2023 that Amhara and Eritrean soldiers continued to occupy Western Tigray. The Amhara continued to contest ownership of the area, and the federal government eventually announced that the political fate of the territory would be decided in a referendum. As of early 2025, however, the referendum is yet to take place.

The effects of the war have been devastating. In 2021 alone, 5.1 million Ethiopians became internally displaced, a record for the most people internally displaced in any country in any single year at the time. Thousands fled to Sudan and other neighboring countries. By the time the Pretoria Agreement took effect, the Tigray War had killed approximately 600,000 people.

Despite the signing of the Pretoria Agreement, instability and violence continued to characterize Ethiopia throughout 2023. In April, the central government announced that all regional security forces—permitted to operate under the national constitution—would be integrated into the national security services. The decision was largely seen as an attempt to degrade the autonomy of the regions, and it sparked violent protests and militia activity across the country. Resistance proliferated in Amhara, forcing the ENDF, in a reversal of alliances, to spend much of the year fighting against regional special forces and a powerful militia known as the Fano, as both groups refused to disband and join the national army. Operations also continued against the OLA, despite several rounds of unsuccessful peace talks.

In 2023, Ethiopia and Eritrea reignited political hostilities, marking a troubling shift in their relationship. Tensions flared between the two countries when Abiy began signaling Ethiopia’s intention to secure a Red Sea port, and, with it, participation in international maritime trade. Ethiopia has been landlocked since the 1990s when the coastal region of Eritrea broke away to form an independent state following a decades-long war of independence. Explaining the importance of sea access for Ethiopia, Abiy commented, “By 2030 [the population of Ethiopia] will be one hundred and fifty million … A population of one hundred and fifty million can’t live in a geographic prison.” The comments were met with widespread concern as a prelude to military action against Eritrea.

In January 2024, Ethiopia signed a memorandum of understanding with Somaliland (a semi-independent state in Somalia), in which it promised to recognize the latter’s independence in exchange for access to a nineteen-kilometer-long stretch of coastline on the Gulf of Aden. Somalia, which has never recognized the independence of Somaliland, threatened war in response.

Insurgencies in Oromia and Amhara intensified in 2024, further challenging the federal government’s authority. In Amhara, the Fano militia launched offensives against major cities for the first time in nearly a year, including Bahir Dar, the region’s capital. Fighting similarly escalated in Oromia, where the government intensified its efforts against the OLA as violence spread ever closer to Addis Ababa. Perhaps most worryingly, conflict returned to Tigray for the first time since the end of the civil war in 2022, signaling a failure to enforce the disarmament provisions laid out by the Pretoria Agreement.

Recent Developments

Recent events have further destabilized Tigray, raising fears of a return to civil war. In August 2024, the TPLF excluded Getachew Reda, the interim regional administrator for the federally-appointed Tigrayan Interim Administration (TIA), from its fourteenth Congress. Getachew responded by declaring the gathering “null and void,” before being permanently expelled from the TPLF in September, along with several senior TIA officials.

Amid growing tensions in Tigray, Prime Minister Ahmed’s government won a series of political victories. In December, it revealed that the Oromia regional government had signed a peace deal with a breakaway faction of the OLA. Then, in December, the Turkish government announced it had mediated a productive discussion between Ethiopia and Somalia, and that the two countries would thereafter recognize, as per the Ankara Declaration, “the potentially diverse benefits that could be derived from Ethiopia’s assured access to and from the sea, whilst respecting the territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Somalia.” Ethiopia and Somalia formally restored diplomatic ties in January 2025.

Since then, however, urgent challenges have emerged for the Ethiopian government. In Tigray, federal authority is quickly shrinking. The TPLF has taken effective control of the region’s two largest cities, Mekelle and Ad Gudan, after a series of skirmishes with federal forces that have killed, injured, and displaced thousands of civilians. The violence threatens to escalate into a regional war between Ethiopia and Eritrea. The two countries have traded diplomatic accusations in recent months, and now appear to have mobilized forces to the border. Eritrea fears an emboldened Abiy may look to seize Assab and Massawa, two ports along the Eritrean coast, in his quest for sea access. Meanwhile, Ethiopia believes Eritrea will capitalize on instability in Tigray to launch an offensive into the region.

Ethiopia’s destabilization holds significant security implications for the Horn of Africa, a region that is facing armed conflict in Somalia, Sudan, and South Sudan. Ethiopia, Egypt, and Sudan have been locked in a political dispute since 2011 over Ethiopia’s construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, a hydroelectric dam on the Nile River that restricts the northern flow of freshwater. During the Tigray War, tensions were also reignited between Ethiopia and Sudan over the fertile border region of Al Fashaga, where governance rights have been contested since the early 1900s. The dispute was exacerbated by Sudan’s support for the TPLF and persists to this day.",Center For Preventive Action,https://microsites-live-backend.cfr.org/cdn/ff/RaqAVaWdM7fVdu6rt5cxuuiOjrC3h-VfY3fxIFdIj34/1623172902/public/2021-06/Tigray_Lead_0.jpg
United States military deployments,Published date not found (newspaper3k),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_military_deployments,"Domestic and international deployments of U.S. military personnel

The military of the United States is deployed in most countries around the world, with more than 160,000 of its active-duty personnel stationed outside the United States and its territories.[1] This list consists of deployments excepting active combat deployments, including troops in Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and Somalia.[2]

Outside of active combat, US personnel are typically deployed as part of several peacekeeping and classified missions, military attachés, or are part of embassy and consulate security.

Rationale [ edit ]

Statements by U.S. military and government [ edit ]

A longstanding justification for maintaining military installations worldwide for the United States is that a military presence abroad by the U.S. promotes and strengthens democracy.

Statements by others [ edit ]

According to Hermann and Kegley, military interventions have boosted democracy in other nations.[4] The majority of academics, however, concur with professor of international politics Abraham Lowenthal that American efforts to spread democracy have been ""negligible, often counterproductive, and only occasionally positive.""[4][5][6]

JoAnn Chirico believes that, as of 2014, the U.S. military presence and installations are often considered responsible for suppressing democracy in countries such as Cameroon, Chad, Ethiopia, Jordan, Kuwait, Niger, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates.

In her 1979 essay, ""Dictatorships and Double Standards"", Jeane Kirkpatrick argued that although the United States should encourage democracy, it should be understood that premature reforms may cause a backlash that could give the Communists an opportunity to take over. For this reason, she considered it legitimate to support non-communist dictatorships, adding that a successful and sustainable democratic process is likely to be a long-term process in many cases in the Third World. The essence of the so-called Kirkpatrick Doctrine is the use of selective methods to advance democracy in order to contain the wave of communism.

These numbers do not include any military or civilian contractors or their dependents. Additionally, countries in which US military are engaged in active combat operations are not included.

Battles with Native Americans [ edit ]

For over 250 years, conflicts between European settlers and Native Americans in America revolved around disputes over land, resources, and trade. These clashes, collectively referred to as the American Indian Wars, involved various Indigenous tribes, as well as the English, French, Spanish, and U.S. Army. As a consequence of these wars, Native American lives were tragically lost, and tribal lands were significantly diminished, ultimately resulting in the forced relocation of survivors to reservations. Outlined below is a chronological account of significant battles and massacres that occurred during these conflicts:

Jamestown Massacre: March 22, 1622 [ edit ]

During the Powhatan Wars, Powhatan Chief Opechancanough orchestrated an attack that claimed the lives of nearly 350 out of the 1,200 colonists. In response, the English launched counterattacks on Native American villages, causing destruction to crops and displacing Indigenous peoples from their ancestral lands.

Pequot War: 1636-37 [ edit ]

Competition for control over the fur and wampum trade in Colonial Connecticut led to escalating tensions and conflicts. In a notable incident on May 26, 1637, English militia, accompanied by members of the Narragansett and Mohegan tribes, launched an assault on the Pequot at Mystic. This resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Pequot individuals, including women and children. Subsequently, many Pequots abandoned their territory, ultimately leading to the dissolution of the Pequot nation through the Treaty of Hartford.[2][3][4]

American Revolutionary War [ edit ]

The American Revolutionary War occurred between 1765 and 1783, during which 13 British North American colonies rebelled against imperial rule. The protests initially arose due to taxes imposed by the British monarchy and Parliament without colonial representation. These disputes escalated into a series of defiant actions and repressive laws, ultimately leading to open rebellion. With the support of France, the American colonies successfully overcame the British forces, gained independence, and established the United States of America. From 1754 to 1763, the British colonies engaged in a costly conflict with France known as the French and Indian War. To recover expenses and generate revenue, the British government introduced various taxes, including the Stamp Act of 1765, the first direct tax on the American colonies. Benjamin Franklin argued before Parliament that the tax was excessive, considering the colonies' contributions during the war. This period also saw the formation of the Sons of Liberty. In 1767, Parliament implemented the Townshend Acts, which imposed duties on essential goods like tea. The seizure of John Hancock's ship, the Liberty, for suspected smuggling in 1768 heightened tensions that culminated in the British occupation of Boston. The Boston Massacre on March 5, 1770, where British soldiers fired into a crowd after being provoked by protestors, resulted in five deaths and six injuries. While John Adams successfully defended the soldiers in court, figures like Samuel Adams seized upon the incident to rally support for the independence movement.[5]

Cherokee War [ edit ]

During the period of the U.S. War of Independence, a series of conflicts and agreements known as the Cherokee–American wars and treaties significantly diminished Cherokee influence and land holdings in Georgia, eastern Tennessee, and western North and South Carolina. This allowed for the expansion of white settlement and speculation in the region. The Cherokee, numbering around 22,000 individuals living in 200 villages, had maintained friendly relations with the British for trading and military purposes since the early 18th century. In 1773, the Treaty of Augusta was signed at the request of both Cherokee and Creek Indians, resulting in the cession of over 2,000,000 acres of tribal land in Georgia to alleviate Indian debts to white traders. Subsequently, in 1775, the Overhill Cherokee agreed to sell a significant portion of land in central Kentucky at the Treaty of Sycamore Shoals, despite this agreement violating British laws. This transaction laid the groundwork for white settlement in the area.[6]

Cherokee and American war [ edit ]

During the upheaval of the Revolution in 1775, the Cherokee faced a multitude of economic, political, and social obstacles. Struggling with severe economic hardships, Cherokee leaders reluctantly consented to a significant land transaction proposed by land speculators from North Carolina. These speculators sought to create a new colony in the region known as “Kaintuckee”, inspired by Daniel Boone's explorations, in order to gain access to valuable Cherokee hunting grounds. In March 1775, discussions occurred between Cherokee elders and the speculators at Sycamore Shoals of the Watauga River in southwest Virginia. The agreement entailed the surrender of 27,000 square miles of Cherokee land in exchange for modest items like blankets, knives, and gunpowder. Dragging Canoe, the son of a more conciliatory Cherokee elder who would later emerge as a key figure in the resistance movement, foresaw the disastrous repercussions of this transaction for his people. He issued a stern caution regarding the imminent devastation that would ensue if additional land deals were struck with the encroaching colonists.[7]

North West Indian War [ edit ]

The Battle of Fallen Timbers, which occurred on August 20, 1794, was a significant military clash between the United States and the Northwest Indian Confederation along the Maumee River near present-day Toledo, Ohio. Following two major defeats suffered by the U.S. at the hands of the confederation, Major General Anthony Wayne assumed command of the U.S. Army and led an expeditionary force of around 3,300 soldiers to retaliate against the allied tribes. This victory put an end to longstanding land disputes between the U.S. and the confederation over what is now Ohio. The conflict highlighted the challenges of frontier relations and the complexities of balancing territorial ambitions with indigenous rights and sovereignty.[8]

Extraterritorial and major domestic deployments [ edit ]

Portions of this list are from the Congressional Research Service report RL30172, version of October 5, 2004.[9]

1775–1783: American Revolutionary War: an armed struggle for secession from the British Empire by the Thirteen Colonies that would subsequently become the United States.

1776–1777: Cherokee War of 1776: a series of armed conflicts when the Cherokee fought to prevent the encroachment of American settlers into eastern Tennessee and eastern Kentucky; under British rule, this land had been preserved as native territory.

1785–1795: Northwest Indian War: a series of battles with various native tribes in present-day Ohio. The goal of the campaign was to affirm American sovereignty over the region and to create increased opportunities for settlement.

1786–1787: Shays' Rebellion: a Western Massachusetts debtor's revolt over a credit squeeze that had financially devastated many farmers. The federal government was fiscally unable to raise an army to assist the state militia in combating the uprising; the weakness of the national government bolstered the arguments in favor of replacing the Articles of Confederation with an updated governmental framework.

1791–1794: Whiskey Rebellion: a series of protests against the institution of a federal tax on the distillation of spirits as a revenue source for repaying the nation's war bonds. The revolt was centered upon southwestern Pennsylvania, although violence occurred throughout the Trans-Appalachian region.

Another contributing factor was the continuation of American trade with Britain, with whom their former French allies were at war. This contest included land actions, such as that in the Dominican Republic city of Puerto Plata, where U.S. Marines captured a French vessel under the guns of the forts. Congress authorized military action through a series of statutes.[9]

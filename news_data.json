        "description": "What we are showing on our Ukraine map and why it looks different from other media outlets’ projects\n\nThis war is different. Although men and machines are also clashing in this one, the global public can this time follow the developments in nearly real time, unlike in past conflicts. At the NZZ, too, we are using the flood of information reaching us from Ukraine to give you the most up-to-date picture of the situation possible. Our interactive map above depicts recent events, territorial gains and losses, satellite imagery, and the position of Russian troops. It is an attempt to map the reality of war.\n\nOptimieren Sie Ihre Browsereinstellungen NZZ.ch benötigt JavaScript für wichtige Funktionen. Ihr Browser oder Adblocker verhindert dies momentan. Bitte passen Sie die Einstellungen an.\n\nHowever, reality is always more complex than what can be represented on a map. Maps always show only a certain point of view, and can only approximate reality. Therefore, we want to be clear here about how our map has been created, so readers can understand what it says and what it does not.\n\nThe short answer: anything relevant to understanding the war that we have been able to verify. The detailed answer, on the other hand, is more complex and – because war is constantly changing – in a constant state of flux.\n\n«Relevant» to us means, for example, the locations in which combat operations are taking place; or strategically important targets that have been attacked or captured such as airports, power plants, transmission towers or bridges. We do not report the destruction of individual buildings unless the attack has symbolic value or has claimed an exceptionally large number of victims. For example: In the embattled city of Mariupol, a theater with hundreds of civilians sheltering in its basements was destroyed.\n\nWe do not show deaths, events that serve (Russian or Ukrainian) propaganda, or those that violate international law. For example, we do not show pictures in which captured soldiers are recognizable.\n\n» Read more about when and why we publish images of dead people here.\n\nWe record on the map only those attacks that we have been able to substantiate through multiple independent sources. Our sources include Twitter, Facebook, Telegram and news agencies. We also include communications from local authorities in our research, but we treat this information with caution.\n\nWe check every picture and video to see if it was taken at the specified location and if the specified time is plausible. For verification purposes we refer to satellite images or Google Street View images, but we also rely on other reliable research networks (such as Bellingcat) or private persons (so-called Osint specialists, more about this here).\n\n» Read more about how Osint experts verify events.\n\n» Read more about how you can recognize fake news on social media yourself.\n\nWe collect current news on a daily basis, even on weekends. In some cases, we are aware of events shortly after they occur, but are unable to verify them until the following day, using further material.\n\nThere is no official information from the Ukrainian or Russian side regarding which areas are under whose control. And if such information was provided, it would not be reliable. Maps have always been misused for political purposes (China, for example, depicts maritime areas as belonging to China in order to strengthen its claim to them).\n\nAt the same time, the nature of warfare has also changed. Attackers do not drive across forests and meadows with a broad front, seeking to annex square meter after square meter, as they did in World War II, for example. Instead, combat operations focus on strategically important roads, cities and facilities. Maps showing large areas held by Russian troops therefore often do not represent the actual influence of a warring party.\n\nThis is illustrated by the following example. The first map is from the Ukrainian organization Liveuamap (more on that later). Instead of entire areas, the creators often mark only individual streets as being held by Russian troops. Information provided by the American Institute for the Study of War appears to show far greater Russian successes for the same day. On the latest map published by Russian newspaper Readovka, areas marked in color as the «war zone» give the impression that large parts of eastern Ukraine are under Russian control.\n\nFor our map we use data from Liveuamap. This organization emerged in 2014 in Ukraine during the annexation of Crimea. Since then, the staff has dealt with various conflicts both in and outside Europe. The NZZ has also relied on its data for other conflicts.\n\nWe rely on information from Henry Schlottman, a former U.S. Army analyst. Using known troop positions before the war began, pictures of (destroyed) Russian war equipment, information from prisoners and other public data, he is able to record the approximate position of each unit. Despite all this information, the data remain approximations.\n\nThe Russian army relies on so-called battalion tactical groups (BTGs). A BTG consists of various individual units and is capable of performing tasks without additional support. It is a central organizational unit in the Russian army and typically consists of infantry, tank companies, artillery, air defense, logistics and other support units, for example.\n\nYes, the map is constantly being adapted and expanded to meet changing needs. We will also update this article on an ongoing basis.",

        "description": "'The mood is changing': Israeli anger grows at conduct of war\n\n4 days ago Share Save Tom Bennett BBC News Reporting from Jerusalem Share Save\n\nGetty Images Anti-war protesters have started carrying photos of Palestinian children killed by Israeli bombs in Gaza\n\nAs Israel's war in Gaza enters a new, violent phase, a growing number of voices within the country are speaking out against it - and how it's being fought. Yair Golan, a left-wing politician and former deputy commander of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), sparked outrage on Monday when he said: \"Israel is on the way to becoming a pariah state, like South Africa was, if we don't return to acting like a sane country. \"A sane state does not wage war against civilians, does not kill babies as a hobby, and does not set itself the goal of depopulating the population,\" he told Israeli public radio's popular morning news programme. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hit back, describing the comments as \"blood libel\". But on Wednesday, a former Israeli minister of defence and IDF chief of staff - Moshe \"Bogi\" Ya'alon - went further. \"This is not a 'hobby',\" he wrote in a post on X, \"but a government policy, whose ultimate goal is to hold on to power. And it is leading us to destruction.\" Just 19 months ago, when Hamas gunmen crossed the fence into Israel and killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, taking 251 others back to Gaza as hostages - statements like these seemed almost unthinkable.\n\nBut now Gaza is in ruins, Israel has launched a new military offensive, and, though it has also agreed to lift its 11-week blockade on the territory, just a trickle of aid has so far entered. Recent polling by Israel's Channel 12 found that 61% of Israelis want to end the war and see the hostages returned. Just 25% support expanding the fighting and occupying Gaza. The Israeli government insists it will destroy Hamas and rescue the remaining hostages. Netanyahu says he can achieve \"total victory\" - and he maintains a strong core of supporters. But the mood among others in Israeli society \"is one of despair, trauma, and a lack of a sense of ability to change anything\", says former Israeli hostage negotiator Gershon Baskin.\n\nGetty Images Protesters have continued demanding a ceasefire and a return of Israeli hostages\n\n\"The overwhelming majority of all the hostage families think that the war has to end, and there has to be an agreement,\" he adds. \"A small minority think that the primary goal of finishing off Hamas is what has to be done, and then the hostages will be freed\".\n\nOn Sunday, around 500 protesters, many wearing T-shirts with the inscription \"Stop the horrors in Gaza\" and carrying pictures of babies killed by Israeli air strikes, attempted to march from the town of Sderot to the Gaza border, in protest at Israel's new offensive. They were led by Standing Together - a small but growing anti-war group of Jewish and Palestinian citizens of Israel. After attempting to block a road, the leader of the group Alon-Lee Green was arrested, along with eight others. From house arrest, Mr Green told the BBC: \"I think it's obvious that you can see an awakening within the Israeli public. You can see that more and more people are taking a position.\" Another Standing Together activist, Uri Weltmann, said he thinks there's a growing belief that continuing the war is \"not only harmful to the Palestinian civilian population, but also risks the lives of hostages, risks the lives of soldiers, risks the lives of all of us\".\n\nGetty Images Gaza's \"whole population is on the brink of starvation,\" according to the United Nations (UN) World Food Programme",

        "description": "Table of Contents Ask Our Chatbot\n\nBy May 2025, more than 52,000 Gazans had been killed, and more than two-thirds of the buildings in the Gaza Strip were damaged or destroyed.\n\nThe next day, Israel declared itself in a state of war for the first time since the Yom Kippur War in 1973. The war began with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) conducting air strikes on the Gaza Strip, followed weeks later by the incursion of ground troops and armored vehicles. A brief ceasefire and a series of hostage exchanges took place in 2025 between late January and early March, but hostilities resumed after negotiations for a second phase of the ceasefire failed to take root. By early May 2025 more than 52,000 Gazans, about 2 percent of the territory’s population, had been killed according to official numbers and more than two-thirds of the buildings in the Gaza Strip had been damaged or destroyed. About 1,700 Israelis had been killed, including those killed in the October 7 attack. Although the agreement led to more than a month of pause in the conflict in the Gaza Strip, its implementation was shaky from the start, and in mid-March the conflict resumed.\n\nIsrael-Hamas War , war between Israel and Palestinian militants, especially Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), that began on October 7, 2023, when Hamas launched a land, sea, and air assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip . The October 7 attack resulted in more than 1,200 deaths, primarily Israeli citizens, making it the deadliest day for Israel since its independence. More than 240 people were taken hostage during the attack.\n\nThat deal was part of a broader regional transformation. The United States, which had long been the driving force behind the peace process, sought a “pivot to Asia” in its foreign policy and hoped an Israeli-Saudi deal would reduce the resources it needed to devote to the Middle East . Iran , meanwhile, was consolidating an “ axis of resistance ” in the region that included Hezbollah in Lebanon , Pres. Bashar al-Assad in Syria , and Houthi rebels in Yemen . Hamas, whose relationship with Iran had been tumultuous in the 2010s, had grown closer to Iran after 2017 and received significant Iranian support to build up its military capacity and capability.\n\nBut while tensions were brewing at home, Saudi Arabia —which had long conditioned diplomatic relations with Israel on the conclusion of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process—had begun negotiating with Israel and the United States on an Israeli-Saudi peace deal . Although Saudi Arabia sought concessions on issues related to the Palestinians, the Palestinians were not directly involved in the discussions and the deal was not expected to satisfy the grievances of the Palestinians in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Many observers believed that disrupting those negotiations was one of the goals of Hamas’s October 7 attack.\n\nIn November 2024 the independent Civilian Commission of Inquiry into October 7, which was organized in July 2024 by survivors of the October 7 attack and the families of victims who were either killed or kidnapped, released a report placing broad blame on the Israeli government for effectively bolstering Hamas throughout Netanyahu’s tenure and leaving the IDF ill prepared for the assault. Although the report named Netanyahu, Yoav Gallant , Benny Gantz , the IDF, and intelligence agencies among those responsible for the security failure, it especially condemned Netanyahu for undermining coordination between the political and military echelons.\n\nAt the close of 2022, Benjamin Netanyahu returned to office as Israel’s prime minister after cobbling together the most far-right cabinet since Israel’s independence, which proved to be domestically destabilizing. The cabinet pushed for reforms to Israel’s basic laws that would bring the judiciary under legislative oversight; the polarizing move led to unprecedented strikes and protests by many Israelis, including thousands of army reservists, concerned over the separation of powers . In August 2023 senior military officials warned lawmakers that the readiness of the IDF for war had begun to weaken. All the while, provocations by Hezbollah were raising the risk of conflict along Israel’s northern border.\n\nIn early 2022 militants from the PIJ and new, localized groups in the West Bank , a territory northeast of the Gaza Strip that is also predominantly inhabited by Palestinians, conducted a string of attacks in Israel. The IDF responded with a series of raids in the West Bank, resulting in the deadliest year for the West Bank since the end of the second Palestinian intifada (uprising; 2000–05). The IDF targeted PIJ militants in the Gaza Strip—but left Hamas alone. In turn, Hamas refrained from escalating the conflict, bolstering the assumption by Israeli officials that they could prioritize other threats over Hamas.\n\nThese conflicts were devastating for the Gaza Strip and came at a high human cost for Gaza’s civilians. But they usually lasted only weeks, resulted in few Israeli civilian casualties, and weakened Hamas’s military capacity. Hostilities often resulted in ceasefire agreements that temporarily eased Israel’s blockade and facilitated the transfer of foreign aid into the Gaza Strip, an approach that critics in Israel referred to as “money for quiet.” Many officials in Israel’s defense establishment maintained that Hamas had been effectively deterred by years of conflict and that an occasional flare-up of violence would be manageable. On October 7 the error of that assumption became tragically clear. Ongoing violence in the West Bank, political turmoil at home, and simmering tensions with Hezbollah in Lebanon were among the distractions that left Israel unprepared for the onslaught from the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe first major conflict between Israel and Hamas, which included Israeli air strikes and a ground invasion, took place at the end of 2008. Hostilities continued to break out, most notably in 2012, 2014, and 2021. Among the factors complicating those hostilities were the high population density of the Gaza Strip and the proliferation of subterranean tunnels there. Those tunnels were used by Hamas and other Gazans to sidestep the blockade, to conduct operations, and to hide from Israeli forces, and they were difficult to detect or destroy, especially when constructed under urban dwellings.\n\nIn 1993 there was a glimmer of hope for a peaceful resolution when the Israeli government and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) reached an agreement on the creation of a Palestinian state alongside an Israeli state (see two-state solution ; Oslo Accords ). Hamas, a militant Palestinian group founded in 1987 and opposed to the more conciliatory stance taken by the PLO, rejected the plan, which included Palestinian recognition of the State of Israel, and carried out a terror campaign in an attempt to disrupt it. The plan was ultimately derailed amid suicide bombings by Hamas and the 1995 assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin by a Jewish extremist. In 2005, in the wake of the collapse of the peace process, Israel unilaterally withdrew from the settlements it had constructed in the Gaza Strip after 1967, and in 2007, after factional conflict within the Palestinian Authority (PA), Hamas emerged as the de facto ruler in the Gaza Strip. The takeover by Hamas prompted a blockade of the Gaza Strip by Israel and Egypt and set the stage for the next decade and a half of continued unrest.\n\nIn 1948 the State of Israel was created on land inhabited by both Jews and Arab Palestinians. Hostilities between the two communities that year led to a mass displacement of Palestinians. Many of them became refugees in the Gaza Strip , a narrow swath of land roughly the size of Philadelphia that had come under the control of Egyptian forces in the 1948–49 Arab-Israeli war . The status of the Palestinians remained unresolved as the protracted Arab-Israeli conflict brought recurrent violence to the region, and the fate of the Gaza Strip fell into the hands of Israel when it occupied the territory in the Six-Day War of 1967.\n\nMore than 240 others were taken into the Gaza Strip as hostages. Many of them were taken from their homes and some from the music festival. Including Israelis with dual citizenship, more than half of those taken hostage collectively held passports from about two dozen countries, effectively pulling several countries into the efforts to release their citizens.\n\nAbout 1,200 people were killed in the assault, which included families attacked in their homes in kibbutzim and attendees of an outdoor music festival . That number largely comprised Israeli civilians but also included foreign nationals. A March 2024 United Nations report found evidence that some were victims of sexual violence before they were killed. Adding to the trauma was the fact that it was the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust .\n\nThe assault began about 6:30 am with a barrage of at least 2,200 rockets launched into Israel in just 20 minutes. During that opening salvo, Hamas used more than half the total number of rockets launched from Gaza during all of 2021’s 11-day conflict. The barrage reportedly overwhelmed the Iron Dome system, the highly successful antimissile defense system deployed throughout Israel, although the IDF did not specify how many missiles penetrated the system. As the rockets rained down on Israel, at least 1,500 militants from Hamas and the PIJ infiltrated Israel at dozens of points by using explosives and bulldozers to breach the border, which was heavily fortified with smart technology, fencing, and concrete. They disabled communication networks for several of the Israeli military posts nearby, allowing them to attack those installations and enter civilian neighborhoods undetected. Militants simultaneously breached the maritime border by motorboat near the coastal town of Zikim. Others crossed into Israel on motorized paragliders .\n\nOn October 7, 2023, Hamas led a stunning coordinated attack , which took place on Shemini Atzeret , a Jewish holiday that closes the autumn thanksgiving festival of Sukkot . Many IDF soldiers were on leave, and the IDF’s attention had been focused on Israel’s northern border rather than on the Gaza Strip in the south.\n\nAt war in the Gaza Strip (2023–24)\n\nOctober 2023: air campaign At 8:23 am on October 7 the IDF announced a state of alert for war and began mobilizing its army reserves (eventually calling up more than 350,000 reservists over the next several days). Two hours later, IDF fighter jets began conducting air strikes in the Gaza Strip. On October 8 Israel declared itself in a state of war, and Netanyahu told residents of the blockaded enclave to “get out now. We will be everywhere and with all our might.” On October 9 Israel ordered a “complete siege” of the Gaza Strip, cutting off water, electricity, food, and fuel from entering the territory. Israel's Iron Dome defense system The Iron Dome antimissile defense system intercepting rockets launched from the Gaza Strip on October 11, 2023. (more) As Israel conducted air strikes, international efforts were made to secure the release of the hostages. Qatar, which in years past had coordinated with Israel on the delivery of international aid packages to the Gaza Strip, became the key mediator, but in the first weeks of the war it managed to negotiate the release of only four of the people held by Hamas. Gaza’s subterranean tunnels—forming an intricate web of passageways extending hundreds of miles—added to the difficulty of locating the hostages as well as targeting militants and their weapons caches: destroying the tunnels without high civilian cost proved difficult, and conducting military activity inside the tunnels presented a high risk for all those inside, especially for the IDF troops and the hostages who might be held there. Just three weeks after Hamas’s assault on October 7, more than 1.4 million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip had become internally displaced, and, with numbers of Palestinians killed still climbing by the thousands, it had already become the deadliest conflict for the Palestinians since the 1948 Arab-Israeli war.\n\nOctober–November 2023: ground invasion and beginning of the humanitarian crisis Israel-Hamas War Destruction in the Jabalia refugee camp from an Israeli air strike in the Gaza Strip on November 1, 2023. (more) At the end of October Israeli ground forces advanced into the Gaza Strip. Communications in the territory were initially cut, restricting the ability of militants to coordinate but also limiting the ability of paramedics and humanitarian organizations to attend to emergencies. Unlike in previous conflicts, the ground invasion was slow and the number of armored vehicles and personnel was increased gradually. On November 1 the Rafah border crossing between the Gaza Strip and Egypt was opened, under conditions agreed to by Egypt, Hamas, and Israel, to allow a limited number of foreign nationals to evacuate the territory for the first time since October 7. On November 22 Israel’s war cabinet agreed to a prisoner exchange with Hamas, which was mediated by Qatar and Egypt, that would coincide with a temporary pause in fighting. During the pause, which lasted seven days, 110 of the hostages were freed in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners. In the days after fighting resumed, Israeli forces moved into Khan Younis, the largest urban center in the south of the Gaza Strip and the location of the homes of senior Hamas leaders, including Yahya Sinwar and Mohammed Deif. A large number of civilians fled to Rafah, one of the last areas in the enclave for civilians to shelter from the ground invasion, and within weeks more than half of the Gaza Strip’s total population had crammed into the city along Egypt’s border.\n\nDecember 2023–January 2024: pressure mounts for a ceasefire By year’s end international pressure weighed heavily on Israel amid the high number of civilian casualties and wide destruction in the Gaza Strip. In mid-December U.S. Pres. Joe Biden, during a fundraising event for his reelection campaign, said that Israel was beginning to lose international support. In early January 2024, after nearly 23,000 Palestinians had been reported dead (a number that included mostly civilians but also Hamas fighters), Israel announced a change in strategy that would result in a more targeted approach. By the end of January the average number of daily deaths was one-third of what it had been in October but was still more than three times that of the 2014 conflict, the deadliest in the Gaza Strip until 2023. (By late July, the number of Palestinians reported dead approached 40,000.) In late January a framework emerged through the mediation of Qatar, Egypt, and the United States for a potential three-phase pause in fighting during which a comprehensive agreement to end the war would be negotiated. The pause would include the release, in stages, of hostages held in the Gaza Strip and Palestinian prisoners taken by Israel since the start of the conflict. But the framework remained elusive as Hamas insisted on guarantees that the hostage exchange would lead to a permanent ceasefire.\n\nFebruary–April 2024: invasion of Rafah looms Rafah as refuge in the Israel-Hamas War From November 2023 to May 2024 Rafah provided refuge for the majority of the population of the entire Gaza Strip, who crowded into makeshift shelters in the last urban area to be affected by the Israeli invasion. Image from January 16, 2024. (more) Israeli officials in February announced their intent to extend the war into Rafah, leading to concerns internationally over the high humanitarian cost of such an operation. Netanyahu insisted, however, that an invasion of Rafah would proceed to root out “the last bastion” of Hamas battalions. A rift between Netanyahu and Biden came out into the open as Biden mulled withholding military support if an invasion of Rafah were to go forward without a comprehensive plan in place to protect civilians. In mid-March the IDF said that it would evacuate a portion of the civilians in Rafah to “humanitarian islands” that it would set up in the center of the Gaza Strip. On March 25, for the first time since the outbreak of the war, the United States refrained from vetoing a resolution by the United Nations (UN) Security Council that called for an immediate ceasefire. On April 1 several vehicles carrying aide workers for chef José Andrés’s World Central Kitchen were hit in an Israeli air strike. The seven workers were killed, and the deaths brought increasing scrutiny on the actions of the IDF in the wake of the growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The IDF took responsibility for the deaths with a government spokesman describing the incident as “a terrible chain of errors.” Early that same month, Hamas rejected a ceasefire proposal that would require it to release 40 living hostages who were female, children, older people, or sick in the initial stages, saying it did not have 40 such hostages. At the end of April, as the IDF readied the Gaza Strip for an evacuation of Rafah, Hamas released videos showing proof of life of three hostages.\n\nMay–June 2024: Rafah invasion, Operation Arnon, and pressure for a ceasefire Although negotiations seemed to be progressing at the beginning of May, talks broke down on May 5. Hours later, Hamas fired rockets at Israeli soldiers who were stationed near the Kerem Shalom border crossing, the main avenue for humanitarian aid. The attack killed four soldiers and prompted Israel to close the crossing to aid convoys. The next day, Israel ordered the evacuation of 100,000 Palestinians from Rafah. That evening, Hamas accepted a ceasefire proposal tendered by mediators that included efforts toward a “permanent cessation” of hostilities, but Israel reiterated its stance that it would reject any proposal that insists on an end to the war. Meanwhile, Israel’s war cabinet unanimously authorized the military to proceed with its plans for Rafah. Israeli forces began moving to take control of the Rafah border crossing and the Philadelphi Corridor and on May 14 they entered the city. Within days the number of people who had fled Rafah since May 6 exceeded 800,000, and the areas they escaped to were deemed inadequate by international observers. On May 17 a floating pier constructed by the United States for international humanitarian aid received its first shipment, but the distribution of aid was repeatedly disrupted by safety concerns and weather damage. It was operational for a total of only 20 days before use of the pier was abandoned in mid-July. In that time, the total amount of aid delivered through the pier fell slightly short of what is needed to sustain the Gaza Strip’s population for just one day. On June 8 Israeli special forces rescued four of the hostages who had been kidnapped at the music festival in an operation that was conducted in central Gaza. The raid took place in two buildings in the Nuseirat refugee camp in the middle of the day. When the four Israelis were recovered alive and unharmed, the Israeli officers gave word to their commanders by radio: “Ha-yahalomim be-yedeinu” (“The diamonds are on hand”). Heavy fighting took place as the special forces escaped with the rescued hostages, and more than 270 Palestinians in the vicinity were killed as air strikes aimed to shield the Israelis. The officer who led the mission, Arnon Zamora, was critically wounded and died shortly afterward; the operation was renamed Operation Arnon in his honor ex post facto. When the rescued hostages revealed that they knew in captivity that protesters were fighting for their release, demonstrators took to the streets in major cities across Israel that night to celebrate the rescue, call on the government to do more to bring the remaining 120 hostages home, and call for Netanyahu to be replaced as prime minister. The following day Benny Gantz, an opponent of Netanyahu who was also a key figure in his war cabinet, carried out a threat made weeks earlier to resign if Netanyahu had still not articulated a plan for the hostages to be released and end the war. On June 10 the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 2735. It called for an immediate ceasefire, a release of hostages, and the safe distribution of humanitarian aid, followed by a permanent end to hostilities in exchange for the release of remaining hostages and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip. The resolution, which was drafted by the United States and followed a ceasefire plan outlined by Biden weeks earlier, was passed with 14 votes in favor; Russia abstained, saying it had questions about the details of the U.S.-drafted resolution.\n\nJuly–September 2024: Hamas drops key demand, Israel demands Philadelphi Corridor, poliovirus detected in the Gaza Strip, and Hamas executes six hostages In early July Hamas and Egyptian officials who were involved in the ceasefire negotiations reported that Hamas had dropped its demand for Israel to commit to a permanent end to hostilities. Meanwhile, Netanyahu began insisting that Israel retain control of the Gaza Strip’s Philadelphi Corridor, a demand that Israel had not previously raised in its May 27 proposal. As talks continued, Israel intensified its operations in Gaza. On July 13 an Israeli strike in Khan Younis targeted Mohammed Deif, Hamas’s top military commander. The strike killed Deif, according to an intelligence assessment by the IDF, and about 90 other Palestinians. Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas’s political chief abroad who was leading Hamas’s delegation in ceasefire negotiations, was killed in Tehran on July 31, leaving the negotiations in the hands of the more hard-line and inaccessible Sinwar. On July 23, as Netanyahu arrived in the United States to address the U.S. Congress, Hamas, Fatah (the Palestinian faction that leads the Palestinian Authority), and 12 other Palestinian factions agreed to a reconciliation deal, which was brokered by the Chinese foreign ministry. The agreement would attempt to bring unified governance to the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, which have been split between Fatah and Hamas rule, respectively, since 2007. It was not immediately clear, however, how the “Beijing Declaration” would differ from past failed attempts at reconciliation, such as those in 2011, 2014, and 2017. Meanwhile, the war’s toll on public health was highlighted in July, after The Lancet published a study that indicated a conservative estimate of about four indirect deaths per one direct death during the war due to destroyed health care infrastructure and shortages of food, water, and safe shelter, bringing the total of direct and indirect deaths due to the war to 186,000. Later that month the IDF announced that it had found poliovirus in sewage and would offer vaccines to its soldiers. It also coordinated with international groups to assess the risk of polio among Gazans and administer vaccines. When the first confirmed case of polio was identified in a 10-month-old infant in mid-August, UN agencies requested a pause in fighting to allow health workers to vaccinate children in the Gaza Strip. On August 28 Netanyahu agreed under U.S. pressure to allow a vaccination campaign to take place in select areas. On August 27 Israeli forces rescued Farhan al-Qadi, a Bedouin Arab from Israel who was working as a security guard when he was taken hostage on October 7. He was the first hostage to be rescued from inside a subterranean tunnel and was alone when he was found. Qadi reported that his captors had fled when they learned the IDF was close by. On August 31 Israeli forces found the bodies of six hostages. Autopsies indicated that they were executed 1–2 days before they were found and nearly two months after Hamas had agreed to release three of them in a July ceasefire proposal. Protests erupted in fury across Israel as hundreds of thousands of Israelis took to the streets to demand Netanyahu reach a deal for the hostages to be released. Histadrut, Israel’s largest trade union, joined the protests on September 2 with a general strike (although a court found the strike illegal and ordered it to end that same afternoon). At a press conference that same day, Netanyahu doubled down on his demand to control the Philadelphi Corridor, which he characterized as “the oxygen of Hamas.” In mid-September Israeli forces focused on weakening Hezbollah in Lebanon—including killing its longtime leader, Hassan Nasrallah—while the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip continued to deteriorate from the unbroken bombardment of the territory and from restrictions on the entrance of humanitarian aid.",

        "description": "Hamas launched its deadly attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, prompting the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to engage in aerial campaigns and ground operations within the Gaza Strip. On January 15, 2025, the United States, Egypt, and Qatar announced that they had mediated a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas to end fifteen months of fighting in Gaza. Hamas released thirty-three of the remaining hostages, while Israel released hundreds of Palestinians from Israeli jails, displaced residents were allowed to return to northern Gaza, and 600 humanitarian aid trucks were permitted to enter the territory each day. However, Israel launched a wave of strikes and ground operations in central and southern Gaza on March 18, bringing an end to the six-week cease-fire.\n\nThe conflict has exacerbated regional tensions across the Middle East. The IDF launched a ground invasion of Lebanon following months of cross-border skirmishes with Hezbollah, which began striking northern Israel following Hamas’s October 7 attack. Yemen’s Houthi rebels have shot missiles at Israel and commercial ships in the Red Sea, and other Iran-backed groups have launched dozens of attacks on U.S. military positions in Iraq and Syria. In April and October of 2024, Iran took the unprecedented step of attacking Israel directly, which prompted Israeli counterstrikes targeting Iranian air defenses and missile manufacturing facilities. (For more on the direct confrontation between Iran and Israel and the role of the United States, visit the “Confrontation with Iran” page. For more on the direct confrontation between Hezbollah and Israel, visit the “Conflict With Hezbollah in Lebanon” page.)\n\nBackground\n\nThe Israeli-Palestinian conflict dates back to the end of the nineteenth century. In 1947, the United Nations adopted Resolution 181, known as the Partition Plan, which sought to divide the British Mandate of Palestine into Arab and Jewish states. On May 14, 1948, the State of Israel was created, sparking the first Arab-Israeli War. The war ended in 1949 with Israel’s victory, but 750,000 Palestinians were displaced, and the territory was divided into 3 parts: the State of Israel, the West Bank (of the Jordan River), and the Gaza Strip.\n\nOver the following years, tensions rose in the region, particularly between Israel and Egypt, Jordan, and Syria. Following the 1956 Suez Crisis and Israel’s invasion of the Sinai Peninsula, Egypt, Jordan, and Syria signed mutual defense pacts in anticipation of a possible mobilization of Israeli troops. In June 1967, following a series of maneuvers by Egyptian President Abdel Gamal Nasser, Israel preemptively attacked Egyptian and Syrian air forces, starting the Six-Day War. After the war, Israel gained territorial control over the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza Strip from Egypt; the West Bank and East Jerusalem from Jordan; and the Golan Heights from Syria.\n\nSix years later, in what is referred to as the Yom Kippur War or the October War, Egypt and Syria launched a surprise two-front attack on Israel to regain their lost territory; the conflict did not result in significant gains for Egypt, Israel, or Syria, but Egyptian President Anwar al-Sadat declared the war a victory for Egypt as it allowed Egypt and Syria to negotiate over previously ceded territory. Finally, in 1979, following a series of cease-fires and peace negotiations, representatives from Egypt and Israel signed the Camp David Accords, a peace treaty that ended the thirty-year conflict between Egypt and Israel.\n\nEven though the Camp David Accords improved relations between Israel and its neighbors, the question of Palestinian self-determination and self-governance remained unresolved. In 1987, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza Strip rose up against the Israeli government in what is known as the first intifada. The 1993 Oslo I Accords mediated the conflict, setting up a framework for the Palestinians to govern themselves in the West Bank and Gaza, and enabled mutual recognition between the newly established Palestinian Authority and Israel’s government. In 1995, the Oslo II Accords expanded on the first agreement, adding provisions that mandated the complete withdrawal of Israel from 6 cities and 450 towns in the West Bank.\n\nIn 2000, sparked in part by Palestinian grievances over Israel’s control over the West Bank, a stagnating peace process, and former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon’s visit to the al-Aqsa mosque—the third holiest site in Islam—in September 2000, Palestinians launched the second intifada, which would last until 2005. In response, the Israeli government approved the construction of a barrier wall around the West Bank in 2002, despite opposition from the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court.\n\nFactionalism among the Palestinians flared up when Hamas won the Palestinian Authority’s parliamentary elections in 2006, deposing longtime majority party Fatah. This gave Hamas, a political and militant movement inspired by the Palestinian Muslim Brotherhood, control of the Gaza Strip. Gaza is a small piece of land on the Mediterranean Sea that borders Egypt to the south and has been under the rule of the semi-autonomous Palestinian Authority since 1993. The United States and European Union, among others, did not acknowledge Hamas’ electoral victory, as the group has been considered a terrorist organization by western governments since the late 1990s. Following Hamas’ seizure of control, violence broke out between Hamas and Fatah. Between 2006 and 2011, a series of failed peace talks and deadly confrontations culminated in an agreement to reconcile. Fatah entered into a unity government with Hamas in 2014.\n\nIn the summer of 2014, clashes in the Palestinian territories precipitated a military confrontation between the Israeli military and Hamas in which Hamas fired nearly three thousand rockets at Israel, and Israel retaliated with a major offensive in Gaza. The skirmish ended in late August 2014 with a cease-fire deal brokered by Egypt, but only after 73 Israelis and 2,251 Palestinians were killed. After a wave of violence between Israelis and Palestinians in 2015, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas of Fatah announced that Palestinians would no longer be bound by the territorial divisions created by the Oslo Accords.\n\nIn March of 2018, Israeli troops killed 183 Palestinians and wounded 6,000 others after some Palestinians stormed the perimeter fence between the Gaza Strip and Israel and threw rocks during an otherwise peaceful demonstration. Just months later, Hamas militants fired over one hundred rockets into Israel, and Israel responded with strikes on more than fifty targets in Gaza during a twenty-four-hour flare-up. The tense political atmosphere resulted in a return to disunity between Fatah and Hamas, with Mahmoud Abbas’ Fatah party controlling the Palestinian Authority from the West Bank and Hamas de facto ruling the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe Donald J. Trump administration reversed longstanding U.S. policy by canceling funding for the UN Relief and Works Agency, which provides aid to Palestinian refugees, and relocating the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The Trump administration also helped broker the Abraham Accords, under which Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates normalized relations with Israel, becoming only the third and fourth countries in the region—following Egypt in 1979 and Jordan in 1994—to do so. Similar deals followed with Morocco [PDF] and Sudan. Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas of Fatah rejected the accords, as did Hamas.\n\nIn early May 2021, after a court ruled in favor of the eviction of several Palestinian families from East Jerusalem properties, protests erupted, with Israeli police employing force against demonstrators. After several consecutive days of violence, Hamas, the militant group that governs Gaza, and other Palestinian militant groups launched hundreds of rockets into Israeli territory. Israel responded with artillery bombardments and airstrikes, killing more than twenty Palestinians and hitting both military and non-military infrastructure, including residential buildings, media headquarters, and refugee and healthcare facilities. After eleven days, Israel and Hamas agreed to a cease-fire, with both sides claiming victory. The fighting killed more than 250 Palestinians and at least 13 Israelis, wounded nearly 2,000 others, and displaced 72,000 Palestinians.\n\nThe most far-right and religious government in Israel’s history, led by Benjamin ‘Bibi’ Netanyahu and his Likud party and comprising two ultra-Orthodox parties and three far-right parties, was inaugurated in late December 2022. The coalition government prioritized the expansion and development of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, endorsed discrimination against LGBTQ+ people on religious grounds, and voted to limit judicial oversight of the government in May 2023 after a delay due to nationwide protests in March.\n\nRecent Developments\n\nIn early October 2023, Hamas fighters fired rockets into Israel and stormed southern Israeli cities and towns across the border of the Gaza Strip in a surprise attack, killing more than 1,300 Israelis, injuring 3,300, and taking hundreds of hostages. One day after the October 7 attack, the Israeli cabinet formally declared war against Hamas, followed by a directive from the defense minister to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to carry out a “complete siege” of Gaza. It is the most significant escalation of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in several decades.\n\nIsrael ordered over one million Palestinian civilians in northern Gaza to evacuate ahead of a ground invasion that commenced on October 27 in conjunction with Israel’s continued aerial assault. From November 24 to November 30, 2023, a temporary truce facilitated the exchange of certain Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails, as well as a surge in humanitarian aid to the Strip. However, hostilities resumed following reports of violations by both Israeli and Hamas forces.\n\nIn January 2024, under pressure from its principal ally, the United States, and amid global scrutiny both over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and doubts about the feasibility of completely eradicating Hamas, Israel signaled its intent to shift to lower-intensity operations in Gaza. The IDF also started to shift its focus from northern Gaza to prepare for a campaign in southern Gaza, including in the city of Rafah.\n\nIsrael’s push for a Rafah operation prompted a public backlash from the Biden administration. In May 2024, news outlets broke that the United States had paused a shipment of bombs to Israel. Administration officials cited concerns that the weapons—primarily 2,000-pound bombs—could cause an unacceptable number of civilian casualties if used in Rafah’s dense, urban environment, where over a million Gazan civilians were sheltering at the time. A week later, President Biden publicly stated that he had warned Netanyahu the United States would withhold certain offensive weapons, including bombs and artillery shells, if the Israeli military launched an operation Rafah. The Biden administration ultimately did not act on this threat as it determined Israel’s campaign in Rafah was sufficiently more targeted than its earlier operations during the war.\n\nIn the fall of 2024, while continuing operations in southern and central Gaza, the IDF launched a renewed offensive in northern Gaza, specifically around the Jabalia refugee camp. The stated goal was to eliminate Hamas militants who had begun regrouping in the area and filling the vacuum left after the Israeli military’s earlier operations. The IDF’s operations in Jabalia raised concerns among experts that Israel might be planning to implement the controversial “Generals’ Plan,” which advocates for a total siege of the area, including the withholding of humanitarian aid, to force the surrender of remaining Hamas militants. Between October 6 and December 31, 2024, the UN attempted to reach the besieged area 165 times. Of those attempts, Israeli authorities denied 149, while the remaining 16 faced impediments.\n\nThe war has raised humanitarian concerns beyond northern Gaza. Since the start of Israeli operations in 2023, multiple reports have documented the targeting of journalists, schools, and Israeli-designated humanitarian zones. Repeated Israeli attacks on medical sites, including hospitals and critical infrastructure, have led to a surge in diseases such as polio throughout the Strip. Violence against humanitarian workers has further exacerbated the crisis. In April 2024, an Israeli airstrike killed seven employees of the World Central Kitchen, and World Food Programme workers were shot in August of that year. These incidents have created a chilling effect on humanitarian agencies operating in Gaza, with many suspending or limiting their operations until they can better ensure their employees’ safety. Additionally, Israel’s ban on many dual-use items in Gaza has hindered humanitarian aid operations. In its efforts to prevent items with potential military applications from reaching Hamas, Israeli inspectors have rejected critical supplies, such as chlorine tablets for water purification, brought in by humanitarian organizations.\n\nAs of January 2025, 1.9 million Gazans—about 90 percent of Gaza’s population—have been displaced and are categorized as facing acute or catastrophic food insecurity. There are currently no functioning hospitals in Gaza. The war has led to over 46,000 Gazan deaths, of which the Israeli military estimates 17,000 were Hamas militants. Israel has argued in many cases that its actions were necessary because Hamas’s guerilla warfare tactics often involve fighters embedding themselves in civilian areas. The military has also cited military successes, including the June 2024 rescue of four living hostages in central Gaza and the elimination of Hamas’s top leadership, including the group’s leader Yahya Sinwar, military chief Mohammed Deif, and Deif’s deputy Marwan Issa. However, the United States has cautioned that it assesses Hamas has been able to recruit replacements for nearly all the fighters that it has lost so far due to the war’s radicalizing effects on Gazans.",

        "description": "Fighting between Houthi rebels and the Saudi coalition that backs Yemen’s internationally recognized government has largely subsided, but Houthis have repeatedly attacked ships transiting the Red Sea in response to Israel's war on Hamas. Dialogue between the Houthis and Saudi Arabia, along with Iranian-Saudi normalization, has provided hope for a negotiated solution. However, talks have yielded little progress and have been punctuated by violence. The Southern Transitional Council (STC) has also renewed calls for an independent southern Yemeni state, complicating peace prospects, and al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) attacks have surged. Meanwhile, the humanitarian crisis has not improved; 21.6 million people need aid, including 11 million children, and more than 4.5 million are displaced.\n\nBackground\n\nYemen’s civil war began in 2014 when Houthi insurgents—Shiite rebels with links to Iran and a history of rising up against the Sunni government—took control of Yemen’s capital and largest city, Sanaa, demanding lower fuel prices and a new government. Following failed negotiations, the rebels seized the presidential palace in January 2015, leading President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi and his government to resign. Beginning in March 2015, a coalition of Gulf states led by Saudi Arabia launched a campaign of economic isolation and air strikes against the Houthi insurgents, with U.S. logistical and intelligence support.\n\nIn February 2015, after escaping from Sanaa, Hadi rescinded his resignation, complicating the UN-supported transitional council formed to govern from the southern port city of Aden. However, a Houthi advance forced Hadi to flee Aden for exile in Saudi Arabia. While he attempted to return to Aden later that year, he ultimately ruled as president in exile.\n\nThe intervention of regional powers in Yemen’s conflict, including Iran and Gulf states led by Saudi Arabia, also drew the country into a regional proxy struggle along the broader Sunni-Shia divide. In June 2015, Saudi Arabia implemented a naval blockade to prevent Iran from supplying the Houthis. In response, Iran dispatched a naval convoy, raising the risk of military escalation between the two countries. The militarization of Yemen’s waters also drew the attention of the U.S. Navy, which has continued to seize Yemen-bound Iranian weapons. The blockade has been at the center of the humanitarian crisis throughout the conflict. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have also led an unrelenting air campaign, with their coalition carrying out over twenty-five thousand air strikes. These strikes have caused over nineteen thousand civilian casualties, and from 2021 to 2022 the Houthis responded with a spate of drone attacks on Saudi Arabia and the UAE.\n\nOn the battleground, the Houthis made fast progress at the start of the war, moving eastward to Marib and pushing south to Aden in early 2015. However, a Saudi intervention pushed the Houthis back north and west until the frontlines stabilized. A UN effort to broker peace talks between allied Houthi rebels and the internationally recognized Yemeni government stalled in the summer of 2016. In the south and east of the country, a growing al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) threatened the government’s control, though its influence has since waned.\n\nIn July 2016, the Houthis and the government of former President Saleh, ousted in 2011 after nearly thirty years in power, announced the formation of a political council to govern Sana’a and much of northern Yemen. However, in December 2017, Saleh broke with the Houthis and called for his followers to take up arms against them. Saleh was killed and his forces were defeated within two days. Meanwhile, Hadi and the internationally recognized governments faced their own challenge: the Southern Transitional Council (STC). Established in 2017, the STC grew out of the southern separatist movement that predates the civil war and controls areas in the southwest around and including Aden. A 2019 Saudi-brokered deal incorporated the STC into the internationally-recognized governments, but the faction could still present challenges.\n\nIn 2018, coalition forces made an offensive push on the coast northward to the strategic city of Hodeidah, the main seaport for northern Yemen. The fighting ended in a ceasefire and commitments to withdraw troops from the city; the ceasefire largely held, but fighting continued elsewhere. Taiz, Yemen’s third largest city, also remained a key point of contention, having been blockaded by the Houthis since 2015. In 2020, the UAE officially withdrew from Yemen, but it maintains extensive influence in the country.\n\nIn February 2021, Houthi rebels launched an offensive to seize Marib, the last stronghold of Yemen’s internationally recognized government, and in early March, Houthi rebels conducted missile air strikes in Saudi Arabia, including targeting oil tankers and facilities and international airports. The Saudi-led coalition responded to the increase in attacks with air strikes targeting Sanaa. The offensive was the deadliest clash since 2018, killing hundreds of fighters and complicating peace processes.\n\nMeanwhile, the conflict has taken a heavy toll on Yemeni civilians, making Yemen the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. The UN estimates that 60 percent of the estimated 377,000 deaths in Yemen between 2015 and the beginning of 2022 were the result of indirect causes like food insecurity and lack of accessible health services. Two-thirds of the population, or 21.6 million Yemenis, remain in dire need of assistance. Five million are at risk of famine, and a cholera outbreak has affected over one million people. All sides of the conflict are reported to have violated human rights and international humanitarian law.\n\nAn economic crisis continues to compound the ongoing humanitarian crisis. In late 2019, the conflict led to the splintering of the economy into two broad economic zones under territories controlled by the Houthis and the Saudi-backed government. In the fall of 2021, the sharp depreciation of Yemen’s currency, particularly in government-controlled areas, significantly reduced people’s purchasing power and pushed many basic necessities even further out of reach, leading to widespread protests across cities in southern Yemen. Security forces forcefully responded to the protests.\n\nSeparate from the ongoing civil war, the United States is suspected of conducting counterterrorism operations in Yemen, relying mainly on air strikes to target al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and militants associated with the self-proclaimed Islamic State. The United States is deeply invested in combating terrorism and violent extremism in Yemen, having collaborated with the Yemeni government on counterterrorism since the bombing of the USS Cole in 2000. Since 2002, the United States has carried out nearly four hundred strikes in Yemen. In April 2016, the United States deployed a small team of forces to advise and assist Saudi-led troops to retake territory from AQAP. In January 2017, a U.S. Special Operations Forces raid in central Yemen killed one U.S. service member, several suspected AQAP-affiliated fighters, and an unknown number of Yemeni civilians. Breaking from previous U.S. policy, President Joe Biden announced an end to U.S. support for Saudi-led offensive operations in Yemen in February 2021 and revoked its designation of the Houthis as a terrorist organization. In January 2024, the Houthis were redesignated as a terrorist organization due to their recent attacks on ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.\n\nIn April 2022, Yemen’s internationally recognized but unpopular president, Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi, resigned after ten years in power to make way for a new seven-member presidential council more representative of Yemen’s political factions. Rashad al-Alimi, a Hadi advisor with close ties to Saudi Arabia and powerful Yemeni politicians, chairs the new council.\n\nRecent Developments\n\nThough a six-month UN-brokered cease-fire officially lapsed in October 2022, both sides have since refrained from major escalatory actions and hostility levels remain low. Peace talks between Saudi and Houthi officials, mediated by Oman, resumed in April 2023, accompanying ongoing UN mediation efforts. However, concrete progress remains elusive, and the first official Houthi visit to the Saudi capital since the war began, on September 14, yielded nothing beyond optimistic statements. The discussions were reportedly centered around a complete reopening of Houthi-controlled ports and Sanaa airport, reconstruction efforts, and a timeline for foreign forces to withdraw from Yemen. Negotiations have also been overshadowed by the suspension of the only commercial air route out of Sanaa and a late September Houthi drone strike that killed four Bahraini members of the Saudi-led coalition.\n\nTalks between Iran and Saudi Arabia in April 2023, mediated by China, have raised hopes of a political settlement to end the conflict in Yemen. The talks led to a breakthrough agreement to re-establish diplomatic relations and re-open both sides' embassies after years of tension and hostility. Iran’s UN mission said that the agreement could accelerate efforts to renew the lapsed cease-fire.\n\nWhile hostility between the two warring sides remains low, AQAP’s political violence surged in May and June, reaching the highest monthly level since November 2022. Most of the violence has been centered around Yemen’s Abyan and Shawba governates, where AQAP has used drones and IEDs to target forces affiliated with the STC. In August 2023, AQAP launched an explosion that killed a military commander and three soldiers from the Security Belt Forces, an armed group loyal to the STC. Earlier that month, AQAP fighters killed five troops from another force affiliated with the separatist council. The recent use of drones by AQAP in Yemen’s south is likely an attempt to reassert its influence in the area despite its waning influence, and some speculate that this sudden and sustained use of drones signals external support. Additionally, AQAP has continued its anti-separatist efforts, with another attack in early October targeting and wounding five STC-backed fighters.\n\nThree days following the October 7 attack on Israel, Yemen’s Houthi leader Abdel-Malek al-Houthi warned that if the United States intervenes in the Hamas-Israel War directly, the group will respond by taking military action. In mid-October, U.S. officials announced that the USS Carney downed several Houthi cruise missiles and drones fired toward Israel. The Houthis continued to launch several rounds of missiles and drones until it officially announced entry into the war to support Palestinians in the Gaza Strip on October 31. Houthi attacks of the same nature continued into November. On November 19, the Houthis hijacked a commercial ship in the Red Sea and have since attacked at least thirty-three others with drones, missiles, and speed boats as of late January 2024. As a result, major shipping companies have stopped using the Red Sea—through which almost 15 percent of global seaborne trade passes—and have rerouted to take longer and costlier journeys around Southern Africa instead. The situation has resulted in heightened shipping and insurance costs, stoking fears of a renewed cost-of-living crisis. In response to the consistent Houthi attacks in the Red Sea, the United States and United Kingdom carried out coordinated air strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen on January 11 and January 22. It is unclear whether the attacks will cease in the near future, with the Houthis vowing to persist in their military operations until a ceasefire is agreed to in the Gaza Strip and aid is allowed into the enclave.",

        "description": "The last United Nations-brokered truce in Yemen ended in October of 2022. While there have not been significant airstrikes or major military offensives since the truce began in April 2022, the warring parties—including Houthi forces, the Yemeni government, and the Saudi- and United Arab Emirates (UAE)-led coalition—have continued to commit serious international human rights and humanitarian law violations in Yemen.\n\nViolations include unlawful attacks that have killed civilians; restrictions on freedom of movement and humanitarian access to and from Taizz, Yemen’s third-largest city; arbitrary detentions; and forced internal displacement. Saudi border guards have carried out mass killings of Ethiopian migrants at the Yemeni border, which may amount to crimes against humanity.\n\nThroughout the nine-year conflict in Yemen, parties to the conflict have perpetrated widespread violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law, causing extensive civilian harm. The conflict has included unlawful attacks, including likely war crimes, targeting homes, hospitals, schools, and markets, a number of which were carried out deliberately and indiscriminately. However, the parties to the conflict, powerful state allies like the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, and UN institutions have failed to hold rights violators accountable. Under customary international law, warring parties are obligated to provide “full reparation for the loss or injury caused” for their violations of international humanitarian law.\n\nYemen is one of the world’s largest humanitarian crises, with more than 21 million Yemenis in need of assistance and suffering from inadequate food, health care, and infrastructure. Despite this, all parties to the conflict have taken actions that have harmed civilians. The Saudi- and UAE-led coalition has attacked food, water, and health infrastructure. The Houthis have imposed an abusive siege on Taizz, and have blocked water from entering the public water network. The Yemeni government and the Houthis impose unnecessary restrictions and regulations on humanitarian organizations and aid projects, creating lengthy delays. And in Aden, the Yemeni government and the Southern Transitional Council have failed to fulfill Aden residents’ right to electricity and water.\n\nHarms against Children in Armed Conflict\n\nYemen’s protracted armed conflict and humanitarian crisis severely impact children. Eleven million children in Yemen need humanitarian assistance, more than 3.1 million are internally displaced, and more than 11,200 have been killed or maimed, according to UNICEF. Parties to the conflict have attacked hospitals and schools, causing disruptions to health services and children’s education. Yemen’s laws explicitly permit corporal punishment of children in the home.\n\nWarring parties’ attacks on water and food infrastructure and their weaponization of water have had especially harmful impacts on children. Many children have had to drop out of school to make time to travel and queue to bring water to their families.\n\nThe Houthis and the Saudi- and UAE-led coalition have committed serious violations against children throughout the war. Indiscriminate attacks have destroyed schools and hospitals and killed or injured thousands of children. Warring parties, including the Houthis and government forces, have recruited and deployed over 4,000 children in combat, according to the UN.\n\nLandmines\n\nLandmines and explosive remnants of war continue to be a major cause of civilian casualties. In the first quarter of 2023 alone unexploded ordinance caused 121 civilian casualties, according to the UN Mission to support the Hudaydah Agreement. On March 23, Save the Children stated that child casualties from landmines and unexploded ordinance (UXO) increased eight-fold from 2018 to 2022, and increased noticeably during the truce, highlighting the deadly legacy of the conflict. According to Save the Children, a child in Yemen was killed or injured by landmines or other UXOs every two days, on average, during 2022.\n\nHouthi forces continue to use anti-personnel landmines in violation of the 1997 Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction, to which Yemen is a party. Houthi forces’ use of mines in areas containing objects critical for survival, including farmland, water sources, and water infrastructure, has exacerbated the humanitarian crisis and contributed to the starvation of civilians, according to Mwatana for Human Rights, an independent Yemeni organization, and Global Rights Compliance. Houthi forces have not shared any maps with mine removal authorities, violating their obligations under the Mine Convention.\n\nMine removal authorities have not followed the International Mine Action Standards in their removal of landmines, explosive remnants of war, and improvised explosive devices.\n\nArbitrary Detention, Torture, and Enforced Disappearance\n\nAll parties to the conflict, including Houthi forces, the Yemeni government, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and various UAE and Saudi-backed Yemeni armed groups have arbitrarily arrested, forcibly disappeared, tortured, and ill-treated detainees across Yemen. Hundreds of Yemenis have been detained at official and unofficial detention centers across the country.\n\nOn May 25, Houthi forces stormed a private residence in Sanaa where Yemeni Bahais were meeting, and detained and subsequently disappeared 17 people. The group was targeted solely on the basis of their religious beliefs. Eleven of the individuals remain disappeared. Houthis have systematically arrested and disappeared Bahais and forced Bahais into exile.\n\nUAE-backed forces, in particular the Southern Transitional Council (STC), continued to arbitrarily arrest and forcibly disappear individuals and maintain at least two informal detention facilities.\n\nWhile Yemen’s internationally recognized government and the Houthis released a combined 887 detainees as part of an exchange in April, many more individuals, including human rights defenders and activists, continued to be arbitrarily detained and disappeared by multiple parties to the conflict.\n\nBlocking and Impeding Humanitarian Access\n\nThe Houthis and the Yemeni government impose unnecessary restrictions and regulations on humanitarian organizations and aid projects, creating lengthy delays. Human Rights Watch has documented many cases of aid interference and obstruction by Houthi forces, including but not limited to lengthy delays for approval of aid projects, blocking aid assessments to identify people’s needs, attempts to control aid monitoring and recipient lists to divert aid to those loyal to the authorities, and violence against aid staff and their property. The Yemeni government has impeded much needed aid through the imposition of complex bureaucratic requirements on aid agencies that have impacted millions of civilians’ ability to access it.\n\nCivilians in the city of Taizz have been severely harmed by Houthi aid obstruction. Residents have faced a dire humanitarian crisis since 2015 when the Houthis closed off all major roads into and out of the city. The International Committee of the Red Cross stated in March 2022 that “the severity of food and water needs is dangerously acute in Taizz.” The road closures have severely restricted the flow of essential goods, including medicine and food, as well as humanitarian access into the city. In 2022, the Houthis rejected a proposal by the UN special envoy’s office to reopen the roads. Since that time, there has been little to no progress in reopening the roads and allowing greater humanitarian aid to enter the city.\n\nRights to Food and Water\n\nYemen has long been one of the most water scarce countries in the world and has a long history of food scarcity. The war has exacerbated Yemen’s existing food and water crisis. At the end of 2022, UN agencies reported that 17.8 million people in Yemen—more than half of the population—did not have access to safe drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene services, and 17 million were food insecure, with 6.1 million facing “emergency” levels of food insecurity.\n\nAccording to Mwatana for Human Rights and Global Rights Compliance, the warring parties have repeatedly carried out attacks on food and water infrastructure across Yemen, including targeting farms, irrigation works, and fishing boats, in violation of the international humanitarian law prohibition on attacking, destroying, removing, or rendering useless objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population.\n\nDroughts and floods, exacerbated by climate change, have also worsened the water crisis in Yemen. Extreme weather events have destroyed irrigation facilities, leading to the loss of agricultural livelihoods, and placed additional pressure on other water and land resources.\n\nAccording to the International Rescue Committee, skyrocketing food prices in recent years have left more than half of the population in need of food assistance, while the sharp depreciation of the Yemeni rial has made imported food, cooking oil, and other necessities more expensive, and has dramatically reduced households’ purchasing power.\n\nWomen’s and Girls’ Rights\n\nYemeni women continue to face restrictions on their freedom of movement in areas under Houthi control, where authorities require them to be accompanied by a mahram (male relative) in order to travel. The mahram requirement bars women from traveling without a male guardian or evidence of their written approval. Increased Houthi restrictions related to the mahram requirement have prevented Yemeni women from working, especially those who must travel, according to Amnesty International. These restrictions also apply to Yemeni women working for humanitarian organizations, which has made it more difficult for them to conduct fieldwork and has impacted access to aid for Yemeni women and girls.\n\nUN human rights experts have detailed the Houthis’ “systematic violations of women’s and girls’ rights,” including their rights to freedom of movement, freedom of expression, health, and work, as well as widespread discrimination.\n\nIn practice, women and girls in the south also face movement restrictions. Some women have reported being stopped at checkpoints when traveling without a mahram from one governorate to another in government-controlled Yemen. According to a coalition of Yemeni NGOs, hotels, particularly in cities like Aden and Taiz, prevent Yemeni women from staying unless they have a mahram. Amnesty International also reported that prison authorities across Yemen as a customary practice do not allow women to leave prison upon completion of their sentences unless they have a male guardian to accompany them on release. If their families refuse to receive them, they release them only to women’s shelters.\n\nSexual Orientation and Gender Identity\n\nYemen’s penal code prohibits same-sex relations. Article 264 punishes anal sex with 100 lashes and one year in prison if participants are not married. If married, the same article prescribes death by stoning. Article 268 punishes sex between women with up to three years in prison.\n\nAbuses against Migrants\n\nSaudi border guards killed at least hundreds of Ethiopian migrants and asylum seekers who tried to cross the Yemen-Saudi border between March 2022 and June 2023. If committed as part of a Saudi government policy to murder migrants, these killings, which appear to have continued, would be a crime against humanity. Human Rights Watch found that Saudi border guards have used explosive weapons to kill many migrants and shot other migrants at close range, including many women and children, in a widespread and systematic pattern of attacks. In some instances, Saudi border guards asked migrants what limb to shoot, and then shot them at close range.\n\nHouthi forces’ role in coordinating security and facilitating access to the border for smugglers and migrants in Saada governorate, coupled with its practice of detaining and extorting migrants, amount to torture, arbitrary detention, and trafficking in persons.\n\nSince the armed conflict began in Yemen in 2014, both the government and the Houthi armed group have detained migrants in poor conditions and exposed them to abuse.\n\nIn June the International Organization for Migration (IOM) estimated that if first-quarter 2023 trends continued more than 160,000 migrants would arrive in Yemen during the year.\n\nAccountability\n\nThere has been virtually no accountability for violations committed by parties to the conflict. Since the UN Human Rights Council narrowly voted to end the mandate of the Group of Eminent Experts on Yemen in October 2021, there has been no independent international mechanism to monitor the human rights situation in Yemen and lay the foundation for accountability for abuses.\n\nOn July 26, over 40 civil society organizations and victim and survivor associations from Yemen launched the Yemen Declaration for Justice and Reconciliation (the Declaration), in which they set forth their common vision for achieving justice and reconciliation in post-conflict Yemen. The declaration underlined that grievances caused by the war have not been sufficiently addressed by parties to the conflict or by the international community.\n\nMwatana for Human Rights and Yale Law School’s Lowenstein International Human Rights Clinic found that the warring parties have failed to effectively provide reparations.\n\nThus far, negotiations between the Houthis and Saudi Arabia have not included discussions of accountability.\n\nKey International Actors\n\nOn April 7, 2022, President Abdo Rabbu Mansour Hadi transferred his presidential authority to an eight-member presidential leadership council, with Yemeni politician Rashad al-Alimi serving as president of the council. The council is backed by Saudi Arabia and the UAE, while Houthi forces continued to receive support from Iran.\n\nArms sales to Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and other coalition members continued from Western countries including the US, the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, and others.\n\nAn internal report from the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) found serious gaps in US government oversight of how arms sold to Saudi Arabia and the UAE are being used. In September, the Washington Post found that the US Army’s Security Assistance Command had been training Saudi border guards for the past eight years in a program that concluded in July.\n\nIn February, international donors pledged US$1.2 billion to the humanitarian response, $3.1 billion less than the $4.3 billion needed for humanitarian programming.",

        "description": "Early Years: Saleh and the Houthis\n\n1990’s – After the reunification of Yemen, Ali Abdullah Saleh transitions from president of North Yemen—a post he had held since 1978—to president of the Republic of Yemen. At the same time, the Zaidi-Shia group Ansar Allah—or the Houthis—gradually gain power; the group’s rise has the tacit support of President Saleh.\n\n1994: Civil War – Just years after the reunification of Yemen, the unintegrated armies of the north and the south face off, resulting in a brief civil war that resulted in the defeat of the southern army and shored up Yemen’s reunification.\n\n2000 – Saleh reaches a border demarcation agreement with Saudi Arabia (Treaty of Jeddah) and seeks to disarm the Houthis, whom he had viewed previously as a useful cudgel against Saudi interference in Yemen.\n\n2004-2010: Houthi Rebellion\n\nTensions run high between Saleh’s government and the Houthis—led by Hussein Badreddin al-Houthi—after Saleh’s border deal with Saudi Arabia. Al-Houthi eventually leads a rebellion against the Yemeni government in 2004.\n\nJune-September 2004 – Starting in June 2004, Saleh’s government begins arresting hundreds of Houthi members and issues a reward for Hussein Badreddin al-Houthi’s arrest. Fighting continues until al-Houthi is killed in September.\n\nMarch-June 2005 – Fighting between the Houthis—now led by Hussein’s brother, Abdul-Malik al-Houthi—and government forces surges, leaving hundreds dead. Fighting ceases after the sides reach an agreement, resulting in the surrender of the Houthis’ top military commander.\n\n2005-2006 – Sporadic clashes between the government and the Houthis continue, but in March 2006, Saleh grants amnesty to 600 Houthi fighters. Saleh goes on to win the 2006 election.\n\nJanuary-June 2007 – Early in 2007, the Houthi rebels and Saleh’s government again find themselves at odds. Fighting continues for five months until Abdul-Malik al-Houthi reaches a ceasefire agreement with Saleh with the help of Qatar.\n\nApril-July 2008 – The ceasefire had not turned a year-old when more fighting breaks out between the government and the rebels. By July, Ali Abdullah Saleh declares an end to the fighting in the Houthi-dominated Saada governorate.\n\n2009-2010: Operation Scorched Earth – In August 2009, the Yemeni military launches Operation Scorched Earth to crush the Houthi rebellion in Saada. At this point, Houthi rebels begin fighting with Saudi forces in cross-border clashes. Fighting continues until, after rounds of offers and counteroffers, Saleh’s government agrees to a ceasefire with Abdul-Malik al-Houthi and the rebels in February 2010. The Yemeni military simultaneously carries out Operation Blow to the Head, a crackdown on both the rebels and al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).\n\nSeptember 2010 – Government forces besiege the governorate of Shabwa in southeast Yemen to root out AQAP militants.\n\n2011: Arab Spring Reaches Yemen\n\nJanuary 2011 – Demonstrations calling for the end of Saleh’s 33-year rule begin. Saleh offers some concessions—promising not to seek reelection—but the protests spread. Security forces and Saleh supporters launch a crackdown that eventually leaves between 200 and 2,000 people dead.\n\nApril 2011 – Saleh’s General People’s Congress (GPC) agrees to a Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)-brokered deal to hand over power, but the president refuses to sign on. This prompts the influential Hashid tribal federation and several army commanders to back the opposition, after which clashes erupt in Sanaa.\n\nJune 2011 – Saleh is seriously injured in a bombing and travels to Saudi Arabia for medical treatment.\n\nSeptember 2011 – Saleh returns to the presidential palace amid renewed clashes. It is not until November 2011 that he signs a deal that has his deputy, Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi, assume power and form a unity government.\n\nFebruary 2012 – Hadi is sworn in for a two-year term as president after an election in which he stood unopposed.\n\nPost-Arab Spring: Unity Government and Houthi Takeover\n\nJanuary 2014 – The National Dialogue Conference concludes after ten months of deliberations, agreeing to a document on which the new constitution would be based.\n\nFebruary 2014 – A presidential panel approves a political transition plan for Yemen that organizes the country into a federation of six regions.\n\nAugust 2014 – Following two weeks of anti-government protests, President Hadi dissolves his cabinet and overturns a controversial rise in fuel prices.\n\nSeptember-October 2014 – The Houthis take control over most of Yemen’s capital, Sanaa. The following month the rebels seize the Red Sea port city of Hodeida.\n\nJanuary 2015 – After being placed under house arrest by the Houthis, Hadi resigns as president. Despite previous attempts to craft a power-sharing agreement between Hadi and the Houthis, the two had continued to clash. The Houthis later reject a draft constitution proposed by Hadi’s government.\n\nFebruary 2015 – The Houthis take control of the Yemeni government, a move swiftly denounced by the United Nations. President Hadi flees the presidential palace in Sanaa and escapes to Aden, where he later rescinds his resignation, declaring himself the legitimate president, and deems the Houthi takeover a “coup.”\n\nMarch 2015 – The Islamic State claims its first major attacks in Yemen, setting off two suicide bombs at Shia mosques in Sanaa. The Houthis start an offensive against government forces, advancing toward southern Yemen. President Hadi flees Aden and takes refuge in Saudi Arabia. Shortly thereafter, the Houthis seize parts of Taiz.\n\nSaudi-led Coalition and Civil War\n\nMarch 2015: Operation Decisive Storm – After repeated pleas from Hadi, a Saudi-led coalition of Arab states—including the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Morocco, Jordan, Bahrain, Sudan, and Kuwait—initiates Operation Decisive Storm in support of the ousted president. The coalition launches air strikes against Houthi targets, deploys small ground forces, and imposes a naval blockade. The United States announces its intention to aid the coalition’s efforts.\n\nApril 2015: Operation Restoring Hope – The coalition declares an end to Operation Decisive Storm. Saudi Arabia announces it would move on to a phase described as Operation Restoring Hope. Despite the announcement, the Saudi-led coalition continues to bomb Houthi positions and the United States increases its arms sales for the Saudi campaign in Yemen.\n\nApril 2015 – Despite the bombing campaign, the Houthis capture the city of Ataq. After three Saudi officers die in a Houthi attack at the Saudi border, Saudi Arabia boosts its border security. The Houthi fighters also condemn a UN Security Council resolution imposing an arms embargo on the group, calling the decision an act of “aggression.”\n\nMay 2015 – Ali Abdullah Saleh had previously been accused of siding with the Houthi rebels in support of Hadi’s ouster; in May, Saleh and Yemeni forces loyal to him announce a formal alliance with the Houthis. The Saudis and Houthis agree to a five-day “humanitarian ceasefire.” US President Barack Obama convenes a GCC meeting at Camp David to resolve the crisis in Yemen, but only two states send their leaders.\n\nAugust 2015 – After months of fighting with Sunni tribesmen and AQAP militants, the Houthis take control of the entire Shabwah governorate.\n\nSeptember 2015 – President Hadi returns to Aden after Saudi-backed government forces and those loyal to Hadi recapture the port city from Houthi forces.\n\nApril 2016 – The United Nations sponsors talks between the Hadi government and the coalition of Houthis and former President Saleh’s General People’s Congress.\n\nOctober 2016-May 2017 – Both sides of the conflict allegedly break ceasefires. The United Nations and others try to broker peace talks and political resolutions. The Houthis claim responsibility for firing missiles into Saudi Arabia, including at the capital, Riyadh.\n\nMay-November 2017 – Humanitarian agencies and watchdogs decry the Yemen crisis as one of the worst humanitarian emergencies in the world. There are thousands of civilians dead and wounded, an outbreak of cholera, and a potential famine that would leave thousands on the brink of starvation.\n\nNovember 2017 – Saudi Arabia intercepts a missile fired toward its airport in Riyadh and blames the Houthis, Iran, and Lebanon’s Hezbollah for escalating the war.\n\nDecember 2017 – After Saleh had reversed course and sided with the Saudi-led coalition, fierce fighting in Sanaa between the Houthis and forces loyal to Saleh leaves the former president dead. The Houthis control much of northern Yemen but face stiff opposition from the Saudi-led coalition. President Hadi—whose loyalists control much of south Yemen—has called for a popular uprising against Houthi rule in the north. Saleh’s son, Ahmed Ali Saleh, has vowed revenge against the Houthis for his father’s assassination.\n\nJanuary 2018 – In a firefight, the Southern Transitional Council (STC), the United Arab Emirates-backed separatist movement seeking a revival of the formerly independent South Yemen, seizes control of Aden, Yemen’s main southern city and government headquarters. By March, 22 million Yemenis require humanitarian aid.\n\nFebruary 2018 – The United Nations appoints longtime British diplomat Martin Griffiths as Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Yemen.\n\nMarch-May 2018 – Fighting escalates along Yemen’s western coast and dozens are killed in Saudi air strikes and security raids. A Saudi-led coalition drone strike kills Saleh Ali al-Sammad, president of Yemen’s Supreme Political Council, making him the most senior Houthi casualty since the coalition began its activities in 2015. International opposition to the coalition’s operations grows after an air raid kills more than 20 at a wedding party. In May, UAE forces take over the island of Socotra, occupying the airport and seaport and causing tensions with Yemeni government officials.\n\nJune-July 2018 – Yemeni President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi meets with UAE Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nayhan and, by July, the coalition launches an offensive on the port city of Hodeida.\n\nAugust-October 2018 – International furor over the Saudi-led coalition’s war in Yemen grows after an air raid strikes a school bus, killing 40, mostly children. Public opinion of US support for the war effort in the United States plummets as it is reported that the bomb used in the air raid was US-supplied. In October, US resident and Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi is assassinated by Saudi agents in Istanbul, raising additional questions about US support for Riyadh’s war on Yemen. UN efforts to mediate between the Yemeni government and the Houthi rebels in Geneva, Switzerland are fruitless.\n\nNovember-December 2018 – The US political establishment begins to agitate for withdrawing US support from the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen. Former Obama Administration officials—including future Secretary of State Antony Blinken, future UN Ambassador nominee Linda Thomas-Greenfield, and future National Security Advisor to President Joe Biden Jake Sullivan—sign an open letter expressing remorse for their support for the war and urging all sides to end the fighting. In December 2018, the US Senate, for the first time, votes to invoke the War Powers Resolution to force the US military to end its participation in the Yemen war.\n\nLater that month, after UN-mediated talks, the Yemeni government and the Houthis sign the Stockholm Agreement that includes prisoner swaps, a mutual redeployment of forces away from Hodeida Port, and a committee to discuss the contested city of Taiz. The cease-fire is set to take effect on December 18. Overall, the Stockholm Agreement fails to achieve its goals and neither side agrees to withdraw from Hodeida.\n\nJanuary-June 2019 – Fighting continues. Houthis launch a drone attack on Al-Anad Air Base north of Aden, injuring dozens and killing the head of Yemeni intelligence. By June, the UAE unilaterally scales back its military presence in Yemen while continuing to support the STC, which had seized more power in Aden. Meanwhile, the Houthis step up efforts to attack Saudi territory, including launching missiles at oil installations and airports. Saudi and Yemeni forces capture Abu Osama al-Muhajer, leader of the so-called Islamic State-Yemen Province (IS-YP).\n\nIn Washington, Secretary of Defense James Mattis’s resignation in December 2018 takes effect in February 2019, marking an end to the Trump Administration’s efforts to engage in the Yemen peace process. In April, President Donald Trump vetoes a bipartisan congressional measure that would force the US military to end its role in the Yemen war.\n\nJuly-September 2019 – The UAE announces it has completed its troop drawdown in Yemen, but by August, the STC effectively assumes control of the southern governorates of Aden, Abyan, and Shabwa. By the end of August, UAE forces conduct air raids against Yemen government forces headed to Aden to regain control.\n\nIn August, the Houthis launch “Operation Victory from God” against Saudi-led forces and the group continues to escalate its attacks on Saudi oil installations. In September, the Houthis claim to have used drones to bomb oil processing facilities in Abqaiq and Khurais in eastern Saudi Arabia. The attacks result in Saudi Arabia losing about half of its output capacity and, while the Houthis take credit for the aggression, the international community blames Iran because it was thought to have provided the technical expertise needed to carry out such attacks.\n\nNovember 2019 – In an effort to end the fighting between ostensible coalition partners in southern Yemen, Saudi Arabia and the UAE broker a power-sharing agreement between their respective partners in the Yemen government forces and the STC. The Riyadh Agreement is signed in early November, but by December, clashes between the two resume.\n\nJanuary-February 2020 – Fighting between the Saudi-led coalition and the Houthis picks up. Houthi forces carry out missile attacks on military training camps and in Saudi Arabia’s southern provinces. They claim to “liberate” roughly 1,550 square miles of territory in the al-Jawf and Marib governorates from Saudi-led forces, a claim the coalition denies.\n\nMarch 2020 – Houthi forces capture the strategic city of al-Hazm in the al-Jawf offensive and Saudi forces carry out a retaliatory air strike on Sanaa. This occurs as the United Nations urges maintaining the cease-fire during the COVID-19 pandemic to prevent its spread in Yemen.\n\nThe Trump Administration announces a freeze on $73 million in humanitarian aid to Yemen, fearing the Houthi rebels would control the assistance.\n\nApril-May 2020 – In April, Saudi Arabia initiates a unilateral two-week cease-fire to mitigate the risks of the new coronavirus pandemic. Days later, Yemen records its first known case of COVID-19. Despite the cease-fire, the Houthis and the Saudi-led coalition are accused of carrying out attacks. In the south, the STC once again demands self-rule, breaking its agreement with the national government.\n\nJune-November 2020 – In June, the Southern Transitional Council deposes the recognized government in Socotra, with government supporters decrying the move as a coup d’état. The following month, the STC says it has renounced its claim to self-rule and will return to the previously agreed-upon power-sharing structure.\n\nIn October, the warring sides in Yemen carry out the conflict’s largest prisoner swap. By November, Saudi Arabia and the Houthis have reportedly initiated back channel talks, with Saudi officials indicating their willingness to sign a cease-fire deal and end the Saudi air and sea blockade in exchange for the creation of a buffer zone between Houthi-controlled territory in Yemen and the kingdom’s borders. The Houthis later claim to have fired a missile at the coastal Saudi city of Jeddah.\n\nDecember 2020 – The STC and the Hadi government formalize a new power-sharing agreement in Aden. Prime Minister Maeen Abdulmalik Saeed is reappointed as head of the Hadi government’s new cabinet, with seats going also to both the STC and Yemen’s Islah Party. Just weeks later, as the new cabinet arrives in Aden from Saudi Arabia, an attack on the airport kills at least two dozen people, but no ministers. The Hadi government, the STC, and much of the international community blame the Houthis for the attack and Saudi warplanes conduct retaliatory raids on Sanaa.\n\nJanuary 2021 – The Trump Administration uses the December attack to justify designating the Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization (FTO). The Houthis are still able to consolidate control over 70-80 percent of the Yemeni population and threaten Marib, a stronghold near the northeast corner of their control zone.\n\nPresident Biden Takes a New Path\n\nFebruary 2021 – President Joe Biden announces changes to US policy toward Yemen, including revoking the Houthi FTO designation, declaring an end to US support for the Saudi-led coalition’s offensive operations in the conflict, appointing Timothy Lenderking as a special envoy for Yemen, supporting the UN-led peace process, and providing assurances to Saudi Arabia regarding the defense of its territory.\n\nHouthi rebels launch an offensive in Marib city, the final stronghold of government forces in the north and near some of northern Yemen’s richest old fields. Marib hosts nearly one million Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), and intense clashes are expected to displace thousands more.\n\nMarch 2021 – Conflict between the Hadi government and the Houthis escalates in Marib governorate. The fighting coincides with ongoing Houthi missile and drone attacks against Saudi oil facilities, airports, and airbases. Saudi Arabia retaliates with airstrikes, particularly in Sanaa. The US condemns Houthi actions. Riyadh proposes a ceasefire, which includes reopening of Hodeida seaport and Sanaa airport. Houthis reject the proposal on the grounds that a full lifting of the ongoing blockade is a prerequisite for any such agreement.\n\nApril-May 2021 – Strikes and counterstrikes continue and escalate. The UN Security Council and Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif voice their support for a ceasefire between the various Yemeni actors. In a discussion with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the US’s Lenderking pushes for the Saudi-led coalition to loosen the blockade on Hodeida and Sanaa. The Houthis refuse to meet with then-UN Special Envoy for Yemen Martin Griffiths to discuss de-escalation of the conflict.\n\nAugust 2021 – Amid continued air attacks from Houthi rebels, the Biden Administration removes its most advanced missile defense systems from Saudi Arabia. The withdrawal follows a Houthi attack that wounded eight civilians on Saudi soil and damaged a commercial airliner.\n\nThe UN outgoing special envoy for Yemen announces nearly 20 million people, or two-thirds of the country’s population, are dependent on humanitarian aid for daily needs. Five million “are one step away from succumbing to famine and the diseases that go with it,” he warns.\n\nAs Houthis continue to gain ground against Hadi government forces in Marib, Oman attempts to broker a peace deal between Saudi Arabia and the Houthis. Houthi negotiators refuse to meet with the newly appointed UN Special Envoy for Yemen, Hans Grundberg, before the Saudi-led coalition commits to the full lifting of the blockade on Hodeida and Sanaa.\n\nSeptember 2021 – After a lull in hostilities, Houthi rebels renew their offensive in the Marib Governorate. The rebels capture Rahabeh, a key district in the south of Marib. Government forces had recaptured Rahabeh from Houthi control in July 2021. The Houthis continue to make progress in the battle for Marib city.\n\nGovernment security forces forcefully respond to widespread protests across southern Yemen, killing three protesters. Yemeni people take to the streets over the collapse of Yemen’s currency and inaccessibility of basic daily necessities.\n\nOn September 18, Houthis execute nine people on charges of involvement in the Saudi-led coalition airstrike in April 2018. The strike killed Saleh Ali al-Sammad, the Houthi-aligned de facto president of Yemen.\n\nOn September 27, a US official delegation (including National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, Timothy Lenderking, and the NSC’s Coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa Brett McGurk) meet with Mohammed bin Salman and Deputy Defense Minister Khalid bin Salman to push for a diplomatic solution for the conflict.\n\nOctober 2021 – The United Nations Human Rights Council votes against renewing the mandate for the Group of Eminent International and Regional Experts on Yemen (GEE), the only independent body monitoring all parties to the conflict. Saudi Arabia is accused of attempting to shut down the investigation, which in 2018 reported possible war crimes committed by all parties.\n\nClashes continue around Marib between Hadi government and the Houthis. On October 17, Houthis gain control of the Usaylan, Bayhan, and Ain districts of Shabwa Governate and the al-Abdiyah and Harib districts of Marib Governate.\n\nNovember 2021 – Houthis seize the former premises of the US Embassy in Sanaa, detaining local employees. The United States calls for their immediate release and demands that the Houthis vacate the premises.\n\nHouthi spokesperson announces capture of Marib’s al-Jubah and Jabal Murad districts, after last month taking al-Abdiyah and Harib. Government forces prepare to defend their last remaining northern stronghold, Marib city. Some two-million civilians are now trapped in Marib Governorate.\n\nCoalition-aligned forces abandon their position in the port city Hodeida, allowing rebels to retake the city. A 2018 cease-fire agreement prohibited fighting between the two sides, and government forces state they are withdrawing troops from Hodeida to send them to reinforce the front lines.\n\nDecember 2021 – Due to falling international funding, the World Food Program (WFP) cuts food aid to Yemen. In November 2021, WFP targeted 11.1 million for food assistance. The cost of food dramatically increases as the humanitarian situation deteriorates.\n\nJanuary – February 2022 – Houthi rebels launch a series of unprecedented attacks against the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, including air attacks across the border and seizing a UAE vessel in the Red Sea. The Saudi-led coalition responds with a bombing campaign in Sanaa, an attack on a northern prison, and a strike on a telecoms facility in Hodeida resulting in a four-day internet blackout across the country. UAE-backed forces regain control of areas near Marib.\n\nOn February 23, the US Treasury Department announces new sanctions against individuals involved in a funding network for the Houthis.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council renews for one year its arms embargo on Yemen, and continues a travel ban and asset freeze on actors who threaten the peace. The Council condemns Houthi attacks on Saudi Arabia and the UAE that struck civilians and civilian infrastructure. (Four countries abstain: Mexico, Ireland, Norway, and Russia).\n\nMarch 2022 – On March 6, the Houthis reach an agreement with the United Nations to address the issue of an abandoned oil tanker in the Red Sea, the FSO Safer, that posed a threat of a massive oil spill.\n\nThe World Food Program declares that the humanitarian situation in Yemen is worsening because of the Russian war on Ukraine.\n\nHouthis continue attacks against Saudi oil facilities, while the coalition continues its strikes against Sanaa and Hodeida.\n\nGCC-sponsored talks in Riyadh begin between the various parties to the Yemen conflict. The Houthis decline to participate, stating that they should be held in a neutral country. Saudi Arabia announces on the same day the cessation of all military operations in Yemen as of March 30.\n\nApril 2022 – The UN brokered a two-month truce between warring parties that is to begin with the holy month of Ramadan. The agreement is a notable step toward peace, as the last nationwide coordinated cessation of hostilities was during peace talks in 2016.\n\nAs peace efforts gain traction with a two-month ceasefire, exiled President Abdrabbu Mansour Hadi transfers powers to a new Presidential Leadership Council. Led by Rashad al-Alimi, members of the council were selected at GCC-sponsored talks in Riyadh, and include individuals associated with the secessionist Southern Transitional Council as well as those formerly part of the government under Hadi. Hadi fires Vice President Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar, who has long been resented by the Houthis, and delegates his powers to the presidential council. After the transfer of power is announced, Saudi Arabia and the UAE say they will provide $3 billion to support Yemen’s decimated economy.\n\nDespite the two-month truce, Houthi forces resume attacks on the front lines of the battle for Marib which have been static since February, when UAE backed forces pushed Houthis out of the center of the Hareb district.\n\nHouthi rebels sign an “action plan” to prevent the recruitment and use of children in armed conflict. A senior Houthi military official had said in 2018 that the group inducted 18,000 child soldiers into its army, some of whom as young as 10 years old.\n\nOctober 2022:\n\nA UN-brokered ceasefire agreement lapsed, though no large-scale conflict began. The truce had produced the lowest levels of deaths from political violence seen since 2015.\n\nMarch 2023:\n\nA China-brokered détente between Iran and Saudi Arabia was finalized this month, paving the way for potential Saudi-Houthi peace talks.\n\nApril 2023:\n\nSaudi and Omani delegations visited the capital of Sanaa to hold talks with Houthi officials. The meetings were a sign of progress in Saudi-Houthi relations, further continuing the trend of normalization in the Middle East.\n\nA week after the talks, the Yemeni government and Houthi rebels freed 869 detainees during a three-day exchange period. Planes full of former detainees were flown between Sanaa, held by the Houthis, and Marib, a government-controlled city in the north.\n\nAugust 2023:\n\nSaudi Arabia publicly stated that it plans to grant $1.2 billion in aid to Yemen’s internationally-recognized government. These funds were to assist the country’s economy, stabilize prices, pay civil servant salaries, and balance the budget.\n\nAl-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) increased the number of attacks in Yemen, reaching the highest monthly level in May and June of this year. Most of AQAP violence was directed at the Southern Transitional Council (STC) and STC-allied forces, with some of the most violent attacks occurring in August. The group’s decreasing influence has led to its increasing use of drones and IEDs.\n\nSeptember 2023:\n\nA delegation of Houthi officials and Omani mediators visited Saudi Arabia for a five-day round of negotiations. This was the first official visit by Houthis to the country since 2014. The discussions included reconstruction plans, a timeline for foreign troop withdrawal from Yemen, and the reopening of the Sanaa airport and ports controlled by the Houthis. Officials were optimistic, yet no concrete agreement was drafted. Nevertheless, both parties have retained a relative truce since the UN-brokered agreement.\n\nNovember 2023:\n\nFollowing the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, the Houthis once again entered international headlines when the group declared war on Israel and shot down a US drone. On November 19, the Iran-funded group hijacked an Israel-linked cargo ship in the Red Sea and held 25 crew members hostage. Since then, the Houthis have continued to attack ships in the Red Sea shipping route.\n\nDecember 2023:\n\nIn response to ongoing Houthi attacks against ships in the Red Sea, the US initiated Operation Prosperity Guardian along with a coalition of 20 other countries, some of which wanted to remain anonymous. Saudi Arabia is notably absent in the list of participants, with Bahrain being the only MENA country.\n\nAt the end of the month, the UN Office of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Yemen Hans Grundberg provided an update on peace talks. The office stated that there was progress in negotiations and that both parties, represented by the Presidential Leadership Council (PLC) President Rashad al-Alimi and the Houthi chief negotiator Mohammed Abdul Salam, have agreed to a set of measures for a ceasefire. Saudi Arabia and Oman were cited as playing key roles in the progress, along with the UN Special Envoy.\n\nJanuary 2024:\n\nThe Biden administration re-designated the Houthis as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT). The administration had de-listed the group in 2021 following a last-minute decision to list them by the Trump Administration just a month before.\n\nFebruary 2024:\n\nHouthi leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi stated that the group will further escalate its attacks on Red Sea shipping if “aggression against Gaza does not stop, along with the siege of the Palestinian people from whom they deny aid and medicine.”\n\nInternational support and aid funding for Yemen has decreased, and humanitarian aid deliveries to Yemen and other countries in need of assistance have been severely delayed.\n\nSaudi Arabia gave $250 million in aid to the Yemeni government for civil servant salaries, the budget deficit, and other government expenses. This was part of the country’s plan, introduced in August 2023, to provide $1.2 billion in aid to the Yemen government.\n\nMarch 2024:\n\nThe Houthis claim their first attack on cargo ships in the Indian Ocean, further expanding their reach as they continue their attacks on shipping in the Red Sea. As of March 12, the Houthis have attacked both naval and commercial vessels in regional waters over 60 times. These attacks have only increased since US-led Operation Prosperity Guardian was launched in December 2023. A peace deal is at a standstill, with talks on pause as Houthi attacks generate international outrage.\n\nThe Houthi group threatened Saudi Arabia that if it allowed US forces, specifically fighter jets, to use its territory and airspace for its Operation Prosperity Guardian, they would target it as well. Saudi Arabia has not become involved in the US-led coalition and has publicly asked the US to “show restraint” when responding to Houthi attacks.\n\nAQAP leader Khalid Batarfi died this month from unknown causes. Saad bin Atef al-Awlaki was chosen as his successor. With new leadership and increasing instability and international focus on Yemen, experts predict a rise in AQAP recruitment and attacks.\n\nThis timeline was created with the assistance of ACW’s past and current interns Gabriella Haedelt, Numan Aksoy, Brandan Hadeed, Hannah Jacobs, and Emily Costello.\n\nPhoto credit: flickr/Rod Waddington",

        "link": "https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/power-struggle-sudan",
        "description": "As the civil war enters its third year, Sudan’s two warring factions remain locked in a deadly power struggle. Death toll estimates vary widely, with the former U.S. envoy for Sudan suggesting as many as one hundred and fifty thousand people have been killed since the conflict began on April 15, 2023. More than fourteen million have been displaced, giving rise to the worst displacement crisis in the world. Nearly three million displaced Sudanese have fled to unstable areas in Chad, Ethiopia, and South Sudan, overrunning refugee camps. The UN continues to plead for more support as more than thirty million need humanitarian assistance, and deteriorating food security risks are triggering the “world’s largest hunger crisis.”\n\nMeanwhile, mediation efforts have failed to produce results as the leaders of the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and Rapid Support Forces (RSF) refuse to halt their violence, and regional and international actors have taken sides in the war. As conditions deteriorate, the World Food Programme’s Carl Skau warned, “we are running out of time.”\n\nBackground\n\nFor the first half of the twentieth century, Sudan was a joint protectorate of Egypt and the United Kingdom, known as the Anglo-Egyptian Condominium. Egypt and the United Kingdom signed a treaty relinquishing sovereignty to the independent Republic of Sudan in 1956. The stark internal divide between the country’s wealthier northern region, which was majority Arab and Muslim, and its less-developed southern region, which was majority Christian or animist, sparked two civil wars, the second of which would see the country split into two states in 2011. The second Sudanese civil war from 1983 to 2005 killed an estimated two million people, with widespread documentation of famine and atrocities. In July 2011, Sudan’s southern territory seceded and formed a new state: the Republic of South Sudan.\n\nThe dictatorship of Omar al-Bashir defined Sudan’s post-colonial period. Bashir seized power in a 1989 coup after serving in the Egyptian military during condominium rule and later as an officer in the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF). As president, he oversaw the Second Sudanese Civil War, the secession of South Sudan, and the conflict in Darfur. The Darfur war, which broke out in 2003, was later condemned by the International Criminal Court (ICC) as a genocide targeting non-Arab populations, including the Fur, Zaghawa, and Masalit peoples in western Sudan. During his regime, Bashir enforced a strict interpretation of sharia, employed private militias and morality police to enforce his decrees, and persecuted Christianity, Sunni apostasy, Shiism, and other minority religious activities. Bashir’s regime survived until 2019. By the final decade of his presidency, Bashir faced increasing popular protests calling for democracy, access to essential services, and a new system of governance. The revolution culminated in an April 2019 coup, which was carried out jointly by the SAF—led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan—and the Rapid Security Forces (RSF), a militia led by Mohamed Hamdan “Hemedti” Dagalo.\n\nThe RSF is the most powerful paramilitary group to emerge from the Bashir era. The RSF evolved from the Janjaweed militia, an Arab-majority armed group funded by Bashir to suppress southern Sudanese rebels and fight in the Darfur War. The group committed brutal attacks and crimes across the Darfur region, including mass displacement, sexual violence, and kidnapping. The first two years of the conflict in Darfur claimed over two hundred thousand lives, with over one hundred thousand more since 2005.\n\nWith Bashir’s support, the loosely coordinated Janjaweed was formally organized under the RSF banner in 2013. Since then, the RSF has been employed as a border guard force, a source of mercenaries for the Saudi coalition in the Yemeni war, and a hired security force to repress popular uprisings. RSF leader Hemedti became one of Sudan’s wealthiest men by seizing control of gold mines.\n\nBefore 2019, Bashir hired the RSF to protect him from coups and assassination attempts. Despite this, the RSF ultimately joined forces with the SAF in the 2019 coup to oust Bashir and establish a transitional government and a new constitution. Burhan led the Transitional Sovereignty Council with Hemedti as his deputy, alongside other military leaders and several civilians.\n\nAmong the civilian members, the council chose Abdalla Hamdok, an economist and development expert, as prime minister. During his brief tenure, he attempted to mitigate Sudan’s extreme economic turmoil and project stability to the outside world. However, the SAF and RSF orchestrated a coup against Hamdok in October 2021 and suspended the constitution. In response, international institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund paused badly needed debt relief and other aid to Sudan. Mass demonstrations demanding a return to civilian control intensified in Khartoum.\n\nHamdok was briefly reinstated as prime minister in November 2021 after agreeing to concede certain governing powers to Burhan and Hemedti. However, he ultimately resigned in January 2022, as Sudanese protestors were dissatisfied with the terms of his reinstatement and the violent actions of security forces, who had repeatedly beaten and killed protestors. Since Hamdok’s resignation, Sudan has had no effective civilian leadership, with Burhan operating as de facto head of state. By early 2022, Burhan and Hemedti were left at the helm of the government, with the power to direct its democratic transition.\n\nNegotiations throughout 2022 over the future of Sudanese governance culminated in a December 2022 deal laying the groundwork for a two-year transition to civilian leadership and national elections. Many citizens rejected the plan due to the contested time frame, the security sector retaining some post-transition state powers, and the failure to hold Burhan, Hemedti, and other security sector figures accountable for violence. Unrest broke out again and persisted from December into the spring, leading to more violent crackdowns on protestors.\n\nMajor sticking points emerged as the transitional government began to negotiate a plan. Foremost was the role of Hemedti and the RSF; the agreement elevated Hemedti to Burhan’s equal, promoting him from general’s deputy. The deal also called for the eventual integration of the RSF into Sudan’s legitimate armed forces under civilian leadership. However, the deal did not specify a deadline for the RSF’s integration into the SAF due to disagreement between Burhan and Hemedti. The two leaders missed an early 2023 deadline to determine conditions for the agreement’s implementation, indicating tension over the RSF-SAF relationship and the future of both forces as subordinates of an elected government.\n\nAs the months passed, the power struggle between Burhan’s SAF and Hemedti’s RSF continued to stall the country’s transition efforts. By early April, SAF troops lined the streets of Khartoum, and RSF soldiers were deployed throughout Sudan. On April 15, a series of explosions shook Khartoum, along with heavy gunfire. SAF and RSF leadership both accused each other of firing first. The involvement of the Wagner Group and foreign military influence, notably from the United Arab Emirates (UAE), has deepened the rivalry at the core of Sudan’s crisis.\n\nThe fighting in Khartoum has persisted, and incidents of violence across the country continued to rise, including in Darfur. The assassination of West Darfur’s governor Khamis Abakar in June 2023, likely by RSF militants, marked an escalation; Abakar had accused the RSF of renewed genocidal attacks against minorities in Darfur. In June 2024, an NGO report stated that over 235 fires had been set in villages across Sudan, with a majority set by militias in Darfur, since fighting erupted in mid-April 2023.\n\nSeveral NGOs, including Human Rights Watch, have documented evidence of numerous mass atrocities committed throughout the conflict, prompting accusations of ethnic cleansing and war crimes. In early November, RSF forces and allied militias killed more than 800 people in a multi-day rampage in Ardamata, a town in western Darfur. This attack reflected a new surge of ethnically driven killings targeting the Masalit in West Darfur. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNCHR) Filippo Grandi warned that current violence is emblematic of the U.S.-recognized genocide in Darfur that killed an estimated 300,000 people between 2003 and 2005. A statement made by the UN in January indicated that between ten thousand and fifteen thousand people were killed in 2023 due to ethnic violence by the RSF and its allies in West Darfur. In April 2024, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield highlighted evidence indicating that women and girls as young as fourteen years old have been victims of sexual violence perpetrated by the RSF.\n\nHumanitarian access remains a crucial concern for many international actors, including the United States, which called on the UN Security Council to authorize aid deliveries through Chad. Conditions in the country were already poor before April 2023 and have worsened since. Over six hundred people died in the first month of fighting, and attacks have destroyed hospitals and other vital infrastructure. In August 2023, the United Nations stated that the conflict in Sudan was “spiraling out of control” as refugees continued to flee the country and the health system collapsed, raising fears of disease outbreaks. The displacement crisis is especially concerning given the instability of its bordering countries. In consequence, the UN Humanitarian and Emergency Relief chief dubbed Sudan “one of the worst humanitarian nightmares in recent history.”\n\nOn March 8, 2024, the UN Security Council (UNSC) passed a resolution calling for an immediate cessation of violence in Sudan. A few days later, the SAF agreed to indirect negotiations with the RSF, mediated by Libya and Turkey. However, the talks broke down on March 11 after a top SAF general rejected the proposal for a ceasefire unless RSF forces withdrew from civilian sites. The statement came after the SAF made significant advances toward recapturing Khartoum. Iranian armed drones partially contributed to the SAF’s successes.\n\nRecent Developments\n\nIn the latter half of 2024, the SAF launched a coordinated offensive around the three metropolitan cities of Khartoum, Omdurman, and Bahri, catching RSF forces off guard. The SAF seized significant territory in the capital for the first time since the RSF took control at the onset of the war. As 2025 began, fighting in Khartoum state intensified, with the SAF retaking key areas around the capital. In January, the SAF drove RSF forces out of Omdurman, recaptured a vital oil refinery just north of Khartoum, and regained near-total control of Bahri. Additionally, in February 2025, SAF forces ended the RSF’s two-year siege of Obeid, a strategic city with railway connections to Khartoum.\n\nIn western Sudan, the RSF has continued its attacks on local rebel forces, SAF personnel, and civilians. El Fasher, the capital of North Darfur, remains the center of fighting between the SAF and its allies and the RSF. RSF targeting of non-Arab ethnic groups in Darfur has raised concerns of genocide, evidenced by the RSF attack and looting of El Fasher’s primary hospital. The humanitarian crisis in Darfur persists, with both sides accused of impeding and looting aid deliveries. The Trump administration’s decision to freeze humanitarian aid threatens to worsen malnutrition and famine in the region.\n\nIn February 2025, RSF leadership and its allies gathered in Nairobi, Kenya, to advance their plan to create a parallel government. They signed a charter outlining key aspects of a post-war government, including secularism, democracy, a decentralized structure, and a unified national army. In early March, the RSF signed a new constitution, signaling its intent to garner diplomatic leverage and legitimacy. That same month, the Sudanese government filed a complaint to the International Court of Justice, accusing the UAE of complicity in genocide due to its arms support for the RSF.",

        "link": "https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/conflict-sudan-map-regional-and-international-actors",
        "description": "Sudan’s civil war has attracted various foreign actors to support one side against the other. In some cases, historically known allies are divided between the main warring sides. More than ten countries in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia are known to have taken part in Sudan’s war, making it one of the region’s many proxy conflicts.\n\nThese countries are Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Qatar, Algeria, Libya, the UAE, Turkey, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Russia, China, Chad, and South Sudan. Saudi Arabia has hosted several peace talks between the two warring sides in the city of Jeddah, but it is said that Riyadh is supporting the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) in this war, contrary to its ally, the UAE, which supports the Rapid Support Forces (RSF).\n\nEgypt, Ethiopia, Saudi Arabia, and UAE\n\nSudan’s African neighbors also have considerable sway over the situation. To the east, Ethiopia and Eritrea are now supporting the paramilitaries of the RSF, which recently fought alongside Ethiopia against the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), which in turn is supporting the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF). Other former rebel groups in Darfur and armed groups in eastern Sudan are fighting alongside the RSF. The head of the Beja Conference, Mussa Mohamed Ahmed, the advisor to former president Omer El-Basher, is backing the SAF. He recently just returned from Eritrea after spending months among his remaining troops and recruits; most hail from his ethnic group of El-Beja tribes.\n\nEgypt, for historical reasons, has always supported the Sudanese army, which was founded during the British-Egyptian colonial administration more than 100 years ago. At the time, the Sudanese and the Egyptian armies were founded as one body. Now, the Egyptian air force has been accused of intervening in Sudan by the head of the Rapid Support Forces, Mohamed Hamdan Daglo Hemedti, in his latest speech on 10 October following the group’s defeat in Jabel Moyia in the province of Sennar.\n\nThe Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam —fiercely opposed by Egypt—further complicated the issue. Cairo is standing with the SAF because it reportedly supports the TPLF rebels.\n\nTo the west, Chad, sharing more than 20 ethnic groups with Sudan, was accused of facilitating and delivering weapons from the United Arab Emirates using its eastern airports in the cities of Abeche and Um-Djaras, the hometown of the former president Idress Debye’ of the RSF; the two countries have denied the accusations. However, Sudanese army leaders and officials kept publicly repeating these accusations. Media reports and the United Nations have independently confirmed weapons are coming from the UAE to Sudan’s RSF.\n\nThe UAE also built a hospital in Abeche in eastern Chad for free medical services to the Sudanese refugees and Chadian people. Reports have suggested medical facilities in Eastern Chad have been used for military activities and smuggling weapons—doctors working there have told me that they have no idea about such military operations going on inside their medical facility.\n\nSouth Sudan, which is entirely economically dependent on Sudan, has finally agreed with the two sides to guarantee the flow of its oil exports. Oil, which only passes through Sudan, represents about 90% of national income. The country received hundreds of thousands of Sudanese refugees fleeing the latest Khartoum war, the third after Chad and Egypt.\n\nRussia, Ukraine, Turkey, and Iran\n\nRussia and Ukraine paradoxically take the same sides in the war in Khartoum. Both support the SAF diplomatically and militarily. Russia continues to support Sudan’s regime as it has historically done at the UN Security Council. Ukraine’s backing of the SAF came in light of its opposition to the Wagner group, which supported the RSF before and after the war. The Wagner Group's involvement in the Ukraine conflict is evident.\n\nA source at the army’s airbase in Omdurman, the twin city of the Sudanese capital, said that early in the war, Ukrainian teams came to their base to fix some of the fighter jets damaged by RSF weapons. The air force is the only advantage that the SAF has over the RSF, which has increased the number of its soldiers during the course of this war; its leaders alleged that they are now over a million strong.\n\nUkrainian and Russian fighters were seen in different parts of Sudan, both in Omdurman in government-controlled areas and Russian fighters were seen in El-Geneiana, the capital of West Darfur State.\n\nTurkey has reportedly offered its famous Bayraktar drones to the army, and Qatar is also supporting the SAF. It is quite understandable why these two countries are backing the army, which now has Islamist factions fighting alongside it, such as the Al-Baraa Ibn Malik brigade . The former Omer El-Basher regime, which the Islamists backed, came to power in a coup and ruled for 30 years.\n\nIran, Sudan’s old ally, is back again after a few years of boycotting relations while El-Basher was still in power, but has since been restored by the SAF leader, Abdul Fattah Al-Burhan. Now, they are back to support the regular army, offering the Muhajir-6 drones, which helped push the RSF out from Omdurman’s strategic locations towards North Khartoum last year. Iranian elements are walking around in the stifling heat of Port Sudan hotels, Sudan’s new capital city, after the army and the sovereign council lost control of most of Khartoum at the beginning of the war last year.\n\nAlgeria has also offered fighter jets to the Sudanese army. It said that the country supports the SAF because the UAE, which supports the RSF, supports Morocco.\n\nThe impact of foreign intervention\n\nAs a result of interventions and support to Sudan’s warring parties, 11 million Sudanese people have been displaced from their homes, making it the world’s largest displacement crisis. Hundreds of thousands of civilians have been killed . Sudan is now facing the most significant famine in the world, making it currently the most catastrophic humanitarian crisis, according to the UN. The warring sides were both accused of committing ethnic cleansing and genocide, especially the RSF in West Darfur State’s El-Geniena.\n\nApart from the humanitarian impact, there is also a political impact; the interests of the different sides in this conflict have complicated the situation further and made any diplomatic or peaceful solution to the war more difficult.\n\nFor example, the SAF refused to participate in any talks in which the UAE was a mediator or even a supervisor, accusing the country of supporting its rivals. It also filed a complaint against that country and Chad at the UN Security Council.\n\nThe SAF has also rejected all the African initiatives to stop the war proposed by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (representing the east and horn of Africa), African Union, Kenya, Uganda, and Ethiopia after accusing them of supporting their rivals.\n\nThe RSF is more flexible in this matter. It has accepted every initiative by any country wanting to stop the war in Sudan through peaceful and diplomatic discourse, except Hemeti's last speech , in which he accused Egypt of supporting the SAF and demanded that the country stop importing Sudanese products to its northern neighbor.\n\nPeople believe that the harsh position of the Sudanese army comes from its Islamist elements, who believe that they can get rid of the RSF. Unless Abu Dhabi and Riyadh agree on how to end this conflict, many see it as prolonging war. All negotiations have failed so far because different countries have different interests and agendas.\n\nThe international community’s role has been very weak. The United States facilitated a temporary ceasefire to evacuate diplomats, their families, and other foreigners living in the country but ignored the issue of the war itself. Only then did it suggest peace talks in Jeddah with the Saudis. When talks failed, the United States insisted on having peaceful humanitarian corridors to deliver the aid, which, once secured, caused the Sudan issue to fade from the spotlight.\n\nNotably, the two US presidential candidates never mentioned Sudan in their speeches during the campaign. The Sudanese and the African people now fear the Trump administration will ignore Sudan as it did in the past.\n\nPeople in Sudan and the broader Middle East and Africa believe that the international community has totally ignored them and that the US outsourced its foreign policy in the region to its allies, such as the UAE and Saudi Arabis, to deal with the urgent issues on their behalf.\n\nThe views represented in this piece are those of the author and do not express the official position of the Wilson Center.",

        "description": "As Sudan enters its third year of full-scale civil war, the conflict shows no sign of abating, with U.N. officials labelling it the largest and most devastating humanitarian crisis in the world. The war has been marked by mass displacement, worsening famine, the collapse of essential services, and widespread reported human rights abuses. 25 million Sudanese civilians, over half of its population, are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance and protection. While estimated death tolls vary significantly, the former U.S. envoy for Sudan has suggested that as many as 150,000 people have been killed since the conflict’s outbreak.\n\nExternal actors have increasingly shaped the course of this conflict. What began as an internal power struggle has transformed into an international battleground driven by broader geopolitical interests. Sudan’s political instability has attracted foreign actors who seek to capitalize on the conflict to expand their influence. These dynamics exemplify the complexities of contemporary warfare, where conflicts are increasingly protracted and less responsive to traditional forms of resolution. Sudan stands as a critical test case for whether the international system can effectively address 21st-century conflicts, driven by opaque networks of regional and global actors vying for influence.\n\nFrom Power Struggle to Civil War\n\nThis conflict began in April 2023 after tensions between two rival military actors, the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), escalated into armed conflict. Following the 2019 ousting of longtime authoritarian leader Omar al-Bashir, Sudan formed a fragile transitional government through a power-sharing agreement between civilian leaders and the military. However, this arrangement collapsed in 2021 after a military coup staged through an alliance between the SAF and RSF. This coup quickly devolved into a power struggle between the groups for dominance over Sudan’s political and security landscape.\n\nThe conflict has seen dramatic shifts in territorial control since its outbreak. The RSF made rapid territorial gains in the early months, seizing most of Khartoum and forcing the SAF to retreat eastward. By late 2023, the RSF controlled most of the Darfur region in Western Sudan and had seized Wad Madani, a strategic city for trade routes east of Khartoum. However, in the latter half of 2024, the SAF launched a coordinated offensive and began to counter the RSF’s stronghold. In January 2025, the SAF recaptured Wad Madani, and in March, retook control of the capital, Khartoum. Despite territorial losses, the RSF has demonstrated evolving technological capabilities. In May 2025, they launched unprecedented drone strikes against Port Sudan, Sudan’s temporary wartime capital and vital maritime gateway. The RSF has also intensified its offensive against El Fasher, one of the SAF’s last remaining bases in the Darfur region.\n\nThroughout this conflict, both the RSF and SAF have been accused of extensive human rights violations against civilians. In Darfur, the RSF has been implicated in numerous accounts of ethnic cleansing targeting the Masalit and other non-Arab communities. Reports document systematic atrocities, including mass killings, sexual violence, and forced displacement. In February 2025, the RSF launched a large-scale ground assault on Zamzam camp near El Fasher, Sudan’s largest displacement camp that sheltered over 500,000 people. This series of attacks resulted in heavy civilian casualties and exacerbated the humanitarian crisis in the region. Both groups have also reportedly engaged in widespread killings of civilians, repeatedly obstructed humanitarian aid, and conducted deliberate attacks on civilian infrastructure.\n\nThe SAF continues to function as the de facto representative of the Sudanese state in international forums, such as the African Union and the United Nations. In contrast, the RSF originated from the Janjaweed militias during the Darfur conflict and was later integrated into the state apparatus. While both were formerly part of the official state structure, many international actors have been reluctant to recognize the latter as a legitimate state security entity. In April 2025, the RSF signed a provisional constitutional declaration to establish a parallel government structure, although this currently lacks any broader legitimacy. Most international forums have refrained from endorsing either actor, instead advocating for the restoration of civilian-led governance in Sudan.\n\nRegional Implications and Alignments\n\nSudan’s conflict has become a destabilizing force throughout Northeast Africa and the broader Sahel region. As of May 2025, nearly 13 million people have been displaced, with significant spillover effects into neighbouring countries. Egypt, Chad, South Sudan, Libya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Uganda and the Central African Republic have all experienced a significant influx of refugees. These countries, already facing their own political instability and economic challenges, are now struggling to manage the increased strain on resources and essential services. The civil war has also significantly disrupted Africa’s interdependent trade routes, exacerbating economic challenges across the region. Severe funding shortages, driven by reductions in official development assistance from several countries, have significantly disrupted the availability of aid.\n\nSouth Sudan has seen an influx of over a million individuals, most of whom are South Sudanese nationals who had previously sought refuge in Sudan. The South Sudanese government has received reports of the RSF operating in its northern regions and allegedly detaining military personnel. This spillover of violence is likely to heighten tensions within South Sudan, which is grappling with its own humanitarian crisis and is struggling to sustain its peace agreement. U.N. officials warn that the country is on the brink of relapsing into full-scale civil war, raising concerns about the risk of a broader regional conflict.\n\nRegional players have provided support to either group in Sudan, with their choices shaped by a combination of long-term strategic goals, ethnic or clan ties, and security considerations. For example, Egypt has been steadfast in its support for the SAF, potentially viewing its formal organizational structure as a more reliable partner in regional negotiations, particularly regarding dialogue over the Nile. Saudi Arabia, sharing Egypt’s concern over regional stability and safeguarding its investments in Sudan, has also extended support to the SAF. Both countries have provided the SAF with significant military aid and diplomatic backing in international forums.\n\nIn contrast, Chad has been implicated in facilitating arms transfers to the RSF. While some suggest this relationship may be influenced by cross-border Arab tribal connections, Chad’s approach may also be driven by practical realities, with the RSF controlling most of Darfur along Chad’s eastern border, making them a necessary partner for managing immediate security concerns. These include preventing the spillover of violence, controlling refugee flows, and containing cross-border militant activity. The precise nature of Chad’s support remains difficult to determine.\n\nSimilarly, Khalifa Haftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA), which dominates eastern Libya, has reportedly maintained close ties with the RSF. These ties reportedly involve arms transfers, logistical coordination, and the use of Libyan air and ground bases as launching points for cargo shipments. Given their similar paramilitary structures and tribal networks, Haftar’s forces likely view the RSF as a key regional ally, reinforcing their shared goals of expanding influence and institutionalizing their power. It is documented that the RSF has also recruited fighters from Sahelian Arab tribes across Libya, Niger, Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad, and the Central African Republic, reflecting the conflict’s complex transnational dimensions.\n\nForeign Involvement",

        "link": "https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/violent-extremism-sahel",
        "description": "The persistent and growing strength of violent extremist organizations in the Sahel threatens to exacerbate the humanitarian crisis and spread instability across Africa, posing significant security and financial risks to the United States and Europe. The continuing collapse of international counterterrorism support, as well as weakening leadership in regional efforts, has created a vacuum in which violent extremism can expand. Organizations including Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen (JNIM), Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS), Islamic State in the West African Province (ISWAP), and others have already taken advantage of that vacuum, using countries in the region as platforms to launch indiscriminate attacks on government forces and civilians alike. Other non-state actors, such as the Wagner Group, have also capitalized on the absence of foreign involvement to expand their influence. The possible convergence of security threats, including increased cooperation among terrorist organizations, and between terrorist and criminal organizations, could intensify the danger those groups pose in the region and beyond.\n\nBackground\n\nSpanning the area from Senegal to Eritrea, situated between the Sahara to the north and the African tropics to the south, the Sahel region has long faced severe, complex security and humanitarian crises. Since gaining independence in the 1960s, many countries in the Sahel have experienced violent extremism due to the confluence of weak and illegitimate governance, economic decline, and the worsening effects of climate change. Violence, conflict, and crime have surged over the last decade, transcending national borders and posing significant challenges to countries both in and outside the region. The Sahel remains a principal transit point for migrants traveling from sub-Saharan Africa to northern coastal states and on to Europe. Further violence could exponentially increase the rate of displacement and migration from the region, compounding pressures on northern and coastal African states and Europe. The epicenters of violence and humanitarian disaster are in the Liptako-Gourma and Lake Chad Basin subregions.\n\nLiptako-Gourma is in the central Sahel, in the borderlands of Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger. Current instability is associated with the collapse of the Libyan state in 2011, which led to the proliferation of weapons and armed fighters in the region. The influx of extremists into northern Mali reignited the dormant Tuareg rebellion [PDF] in 2012, which had previously surfaced in 1963, 1990, and 2006. Representing only 10 percent of the Malian population, the Tuareg people, organized under the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA), sought an autonomous state and aligned themselves with multiple Islamist groups, including al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), the Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa (MUJAO), and Ansar Dine to push government forces out of the north. Then-President Amadou Toumani Touré was deposed in a March 2012 coup by the army, which disapproved of the government’s failure to suppress the rebellion. The consequent collapse of state institutions in the north enabled the MNLA to capture the regional capitals of Gao, Kidal, and Timbuktu; the group had declared the independent state of Azawad [PDF] in northern Mali by April. The MNLA quickly split from al-Qaeda and other allied Islamist groups in June following their attempt to impose Islamic law and declare an Islamic caliphate over the northern territory.\n\nAfter a period of relative calm, the crisis deteriorated in January 2013 as AQIM, MUJAO, and Ansar Dine pushed further south to capture Konna in central Mali. In August, Mali transitioned back to a civilian-led government under Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta, which later signed a peace agreement with a coalition of Tuareg independence groups including the MNLA in 2015. The coalition excluded Islamist organizations, which quickly took advantage of the agreement to expand their control, spreading further into central Mali and neighboring Burkina Faso and Niger. Liptako-Gourma has since become a hotbed for violent extremism in the Sahel.\n\nNotable attacks targeting the Radisson Blu Hotel in Mali, the Splendid Hotel in Burkina Faso, and L’Etoule du Sud Hotel in Ivory Coast in 2015 and 2016 demonstrated the extent of the Islamist threat to the Sahel and West Africa. In September 2016, the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS) surfaced in Burkina Faso, launching its first major attack on a border post near the Burkinabe city of Markoye. In 2017, several al-Qaeda affiliates merged to form Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen (JNIM). The emergence of ISGS and JNIM have intensified violence in the Sahel. Both JNIM and ISGS have pushed farther south in Liptako-Gourma, threatening the security of West Africa’s relatively stable coastal states. JNIM has more recently gained control over territory in northern and central Mali, while ISGS has been confined to northern Burkina Faso and western Niger due to clashes with JNIM that began in 2020.\n\nViolent extremism in the Lake Chad Basin at the intersection of Cameroon, Chad, Niger, and Nigeria prevailed in the same period with the reemergence of Boko Haram in northern Nigeria. Founded by Muhammed Yusuf in northeastern Nigeria in 2002, Boko Haram was forced underground in 2009 after Nigerian police forces killed over seven hundred members, including Yusuf, during a raid that July. In June and August 2011, Boko Haram resurfaced, indicating its more expansive and aggressive strategy by launching suicide attacks [PDF] on police and the UN headquarters in Abuja, Nigeria. The group gained international notoriety following its abduction of 276 girls from the town of Chibok, Nigeria, giving rise to the global Bring Back Our Girls movement in April 2014.\n\nIn 2015, Boko Haram pledged allegiance to the self-proclaimed Islamic State and rebranded as the Islamic State in the West African Province (ISWAP). A splinter faction of the original Boko Haram was active until 2021, when ISWAP killed its leader, absorbed its territory, and relegated its members to remote islands in Lake Chad. ISWAP has since established control of northeastern Nigeria and parts of Niger.\n\nExperts attribute the expansion of violent extremism in the Sahel to persistently weak governance, characterized by corruption, democratic backsliding, legitimacy deficits, and human rights violations. Many countries in the region share similar internal dynamics of inequality [PDF]—state power tends to be concentrated in southern, urban regions while rural, northern areas remain underdeveloped and ripe for exploitation by extremist groups. Thus, Sahel countries are consistently ranked high on the Fragile State Index, particularly Chad, Mali, and Nigeria. Frequent transfers of power are also a problem: Chad, Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger experienced a combined twenty-five successful coups d’état between 1960 and 2022. Consecutive military coups in Mali in 2020 and 2021, resulting in Mali’s current interim government under a military junta, launched the region’s most recent so-called coup epidemic, which saw similar occurrences in Burkina Faso, Chad, and Niger.\n\nThe death of Chadian President Idriss Déby on April 20, 2021, created a leadership crisis in regional counterterrorism efforts. Under Déby, Chad and its military acted as a linchpin in regional security coalitions across both Liptako-Gourma and the Lake Chad Basin. The Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF)—comprised of Benin, Cameroon, Chad, Niger, and Nigeria—was activated in 2014 to respond to the threat of Boko Haram, organized crime, and banditry in the Lake Chad Basin. In February 2017, France and the Group of Five for the Sahel (G5) countries—Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger—announced the creation of the G5 Sahel Force, a five-thousand-troop-strong counterterrorism force aimed at fighting militant groups with an expanded mandate to cross borders in the Sahel region. Increasing civilian casualties and severe human rights violations by security forces in Chad, Mali, and Nigeria have further undermined regional and national efforts.\n\nIn 2013, international involvement began in earnest when French forces entered Mali at the request of the Malian government. Operation Serval, later transformed into Operation Barkhane, became a three-thousand-strong force based in N’Djamena, Chad, focused on rooting out violent extremists in Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger, in partnership with local governments and with the support of Chad and Mauritania. In 2015, Operation Barkhane’s mandate expanded to provide additional support to the MNJTF [PDF] in its fight against Boko Haram. Operation Barkhane was quickly succeeded by the establishment of the UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINSUMA) and, in 2020, support from the European Union–led Task Force Takuba. By 2020, France had deployed 5,100 troops supported by 15,000 UN peacekeepers from around the world.\n\nThe United States has also provided logistics and advisory support to both the MNJTF and G5 Sahel Force. In addition, the U.S. military has increased its presence in the Sahel, deploying approximately 1,500 troops to the region and building a drone base in Niger as a platform for strikes against groups across West and North Africa. On October 4, 2017, members of the U.S. Special Operations Task Force were ambushed by an Islamic State–affiliate group in Tongo Tongo, Niger, leading to the deaths of four servicemen. The United States also remains a top donor of humanitarian assistance; continues to provide military training, such as the Flintlock program; and has delivered millions of dollars of arms to the region.\n\nDespite increased international involvement, the campaign against militants has instead caused the spread of militancy to countries across the Sahel. That failure, coupled with France’s growing unpopularity in its former colonies, led French President Emmanuel Macron to announce on July 13, 2021, that Operation Barkhane would end in the first quarter of 2022. In February 2022, France and its European allies comprising Task Force Takuba also announced their intent to withdraw all troops from Mali, ending their nearly decade-long intervention.\n\nViolent extremists exploited the resulting security vacuum with heightened attacks across the Sahel. The first six months of 2022 saw a dramatic increase in attacks, particularly in the Liptako-Gourma area and spilling into coastal West Africa. More than two thousand civilians were killed during this period, an over 50 percent increase from 2021. Many attacks have specifically targeted MINUSMA, which has been dubbed the United Nations’ most dangerous peacekeeping mission. In lieu of French support, the Malian military junta sought security assistance from the Wagner Group, a Russian mercenary organization involved in other fragile contexts including the Central African Republic, Libya, Mozambique, Sudan, Syria, and Ukraine. Since its introduction in December 2021, the Wagner Group has deployed one thousand mercenaries to Mali housed at fifteen outposts, including former French bases. March 2022 was the deadliest month recorded by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project since 1997—coinciding with renewed activism by ISGS along the Niger-Mali border and the Moura massacre in central Mali. On March 23, Malian soldiers accompanied by Russian mercenaries from the Wagner Group launched a five-day attack on the town to root out Islamist militants, killing more than three hundred civilians.\n\nProspects for regional and international counterterrorism efforts deteriorated further in May 2022 when the Malian government officially terminated its Defense Cooperation Treaty with France alongside the Status of Force Agreement formerly governing France and the European Union’s operations in the country. Mali’s military government also pulled out of the G5 Sahel—greatly diminishing the organization’s counterterrorism capacity. In June, JNIM killed 132 villagers in central Mali, the deadliest attack on civilians since the coup.\n\nIn June 2023, Mali’s government demanded the departure of MINUSMA, the UN peacekeeping force. The UN agreed to withdraw within six months, raising concerns of a power vacuum and setbacks for Mali’s transition to civilian rule, for which the junta claims a June 2023 referendum was a first step. MINUSMA has also played a key role in assuaging Tuareg separatists, who warn that the UN departure will deal a “fatal blow” to the peace agreement.\n\nAn acute humanitarian crisis is exacerbating violent extremism’s threat to regional stability. The last decade of conflict has displaced 2.6 million people in Liptako-Gourma and 2.8 million people in the Lake Chad Basin, with hundreds of thousands of refugees pouring into neighboring countries. Sahel countries consistently rank [PDF] among the world’s poorest with compounding issues [PDF] of poverty, food insecurity, high unemployment, and the world’s fastest-growing population. The Lake Chad Basin crisis has long been recognized as one of the worst humanitarian disasters in the world due to the severe harm of climate change and weak governance in rural areas. Temperatures in the Sahel are rising 1.5 times faster than the global average, directly damaging the livelihoods of millions dependent upon natural resources. Diminishing land and water resources have led to increasingly frequent clashes between herding, farming, and fishing communities. Violent extremist organizations have not only helped worsen humanitarian conditions, including by targeting humanitarian workers, but have also exploited [PDF] insecure conditions to recruit and control populations in the Sahel. In addition, the weakened economies and proliferating violent extremists have increased illicit activity and criminal organizations in the region, further contributing to instability.\n\nRecent Developments\n\nIn January 2023, UN experts advocated for an independent investigation into potential war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by government forces and the Wagner Group in Mali. The experts claimed a “climate of terror and complete impunity” characterized the Wagner Group’s activities in the country, pointing to the Moura massacre in March 2022. Wagner’s future in West Africa is less certain after the group’s failed June 2023 rebellion in Russia, but Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia would allow its African operations to continue. In July 2023, the United States accused Wagner Group leader Yevgeny Prigozhin of orchestrating Mali’s decision to expel MINUSMA to advance Wagner’s interests. Neighboring Burkina Faso has denied contracting Wagner Group, but the interim president said Russia is a strategic ally.\n\nIn 2023, security forces in Mali and Burkina Faso faced allegations of civilian massacres. First, in April, survivors of a massacre in Burkina Faso blamed the military for the deaths of 136 civilians. Then, in May, the UN released a report accusing Malian soldiers and foreign fighters of executing more than five hundred civilians in a March 2022 operation. Meanwhile, armed groups have stepped up attacks on poorly trained civilian volunteer forces. The withdrawal of the UN from Mali raises the risk of violence against civilians, as extremist groups might attempt to seize urban centers as they have in Burkina Faso.\n\nA July 26 coup d’etat in Niger, the ninth attempted overthrow of a West African government in the last three years, dealt a significant blow to counterterrorism and stabilization efforts in the Sahel. Niger’s government fended off a coup attempt in March 2021, two days before President-elect Mohamed Bazoum assumed office, but the most recent coup attempt succeeded in unseating him. Despite pressure from ECOWAS, including sanctions and the threat of military intervention, the coup leaders have refused to cede power and declared a new government. The military junta have since announced that they will prosecute Bazoum for treason; Bazoum is currently being held in an undisclosed location after a failed escape from his home in Niamey. In response, the African Union suspended Niger, which was the institution's first public communication since it convened immediately following the coup. Nearby military regimes Guinea, Burkina Faso, and Mali have backed junta, with the latter two vowing to treat military intervention in Niger as a “declaration of war.” On September 16, the military leaders of Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger signed a mutual defense pact, solidifying their alliance against external intervention.\n\nNiger had become the West’s last major counterterrorism partner in the Sahel in recent years after a series of coups in neighboring countries, but the takeover threatens to upend its status as a bulwark against an expanding power vacuum. Shortly after seizing power, the coup leaders ceased military cooperation with France, which moved its troops to Niger in 2022 as its relations with Mali deteriorated. On October 22, France completed the withdrawal of its forces from Niger, repatriating troops and equipment via Chad and Cameroon.\n\nIn contrast, the United States signaled that it will pursue pragmatic relations with Niger's military junta. This came shortly after the United States officially designated the military takeover a coup, requiring the United States to suspend over $500 million in economic and military aid. The United States still maintains around one thousand troops in the country, and recently resumed drone flights and manned counterterrorism operations from its bases in the country. However, there is increased fear that Russia's Wagner Group is \"taking advantage\" of Niger's instability to expand its regional influence, as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned after the coup.\n\nMeanwhile, extremist violence has surged across the Sahel. The first seven months of 2023 saw at least 7,800 civilian deaths, a significant increase from 2022, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED). This data contradicts claims by the military juntas in Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger that they are effectively tackling insecurity.\n\nMali is on the brink of civil war as Islamist groups and Tuareg rebels consolidate power in northern Mali. The increase in violence coincides with the withdrawal of UN peacekeepers with attacks more than doubling since they completed the first phase in August. JNIM, in particular, has taken advantage of the withdrawal to launch a renewed offensive, blockading the northern city of Timbuktu and carrying out a series of attacks on military and civilian targets. In parallel, Mali has redeployed its forces to the northeast as clashes intensify with Tuareg rebels comprising the Coordination of Azawad Movements (CMA). The Wagner Group is said to be leading the Malian offensive to overtake the rebel stronghold in Kidal.\n\nRecent violence in Mali has spilled over into neighboring Burkina Faso and Niger. On September 5, seventeen soldiers and thirty-six volunteer fighters were killed in clashes with Islamist militants in northern Burkina Faso. Less than a month later, twenty-nine soldiers were killed in an attack by ISGS in western Niger. Worsening instability has led to increasing democratic backsliding as the military governments in Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger are struggling to regain control in the wake of dissolving international support.",

        "description": "War in West Africa\n\nA war in the Sahel region of West Africa has been ongoing since the 2011 Arab Spring. In particular, the intensive conflict in the three countries of Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso has been referred to as the Sahel War.\n\nThe conflict is generally seen to have begun during the early stages of the Mali War, which itself was seen as a spillover conflict of the Insurgency in the Maghreb. As Islamist Tuareg rebels overran Mali in 2012, a concurrent insurgency in Nigeria, led by Boko Haram, began to spread to nearby countries. By 2015, the Mali war had spread to Burkina Faso and Niger, which led to heavy fighting and humanitarian crises in both countries.\n\nThe conflict in Nigeria also reached a climax before a 2015 coalition offensive forced insurgents into remission. By 2019, the effects of the region-wide conflict began to accelerate due to resentment within the populace and due to alleged inability to handle the conflict. These views led to a series of coups in Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Sudan, Chad and Guinea, which led to the region being labeled a 'coup belt'.\n\nBackground [ edit ]\n\nSince 2007, al-Qaeda in the Maghreb (AQIM) has been engaging the Algerian government in an insurgency campaign in the Maghreb. AQIM fighters are mostly drawn from the Algerian and local Saharan communities (such as the Tuareg and the tribal clans of Mali).[34] After the First Libyan Civil War in 2011, south-western Libya has offered sanctuaries to the AQIM Islamic Jihadists, which dispatched cells to be established in the region.[35]\n\nWestern Sahel [ edit ]\n\nMali [ edit ]\n\nA map showing the fullest extent of rebel-held territory, January 2013\n\nThe military situation in Mali in 2024. For a detailed map, see here.\n\nTuareg rebellion and Malian civil war [ edit ]\n\nAfter the end of the 2011 Libyan Civil War, an influx of weaponry led to the arming of the Tuareg in their demand for greater autonomy and independence of their homeland in northern Mali, which they called Azawad.[36] In Libya, the Tuareg people largely supported Gaddafi during the war, and Tuareg areas such as Ghat remain Gaddafi loyalist strongholds.[37] Tuareg fighters who fought for Gaddafi began to return from Libya after the war ended, citing discrimination from the new government.[38]\n\nIn October 2011, the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA) was formed from rebels of previous Tuareg rebellions and fighters who had returned from Libya. Another Tuareg-dominated group, the Islamist Ansar Dine, also fought against the Malian government. However, unlike the MNLA, it does not seek independence but rather the impositions of sharia across united Mali.[39]\n\nIn March 2012, Malian President Amadou Toumani Touré was ousted in a coup d'état over his handling of the conflict. Following the coup, Northern Mali's three largest cities, Kidal, Gao and Timbuktu, were overrun by the rebels.[40]\n\nOn 6 April 2012, the MNLA said that it had accomplished its goals and proclaimed Azawad to be independent from Mali.[41]\n\nThe MNLA were initially backed by Ansar Dine. However, Ansar Dine and other Islamist groups, including Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa (MUJAO), a splinter group of AQIM, began imposing strict Sharia law in conquered territories. They soon came into conflict with the MNLA. By July 2012, the MNLA had lost control of most of northern Mali to the Islamists.[42]\n\nBy January 2013, Islamist forces advanced to 600 km from the capital and were closing in to capture the major town of Mopti. The MNLA began peace talks to realign with the Malian government while the French military launched Opération Serval on January 11, intervening in the conflict. A French air campaign helped the Malian government to push back Islamist advances, allowing them to take back the major cities of Timbuktu, Gao and Kidal. By the end of May 2013, Islamist and Tuareg forces had to retreat to the desert of northeastern Mali.\n\nForeign interventions [ edit ]\n\nSince February 2007 the United States and partner nations in the Saharan and Sahel regions of Africa conduct Operation Juniper Shield, consisting of counterterrorism efforts and policing of arms and drug trafficking across central Africa.\n\nThe French Opération Serval ended in July 2014. Operation Barkhane commenced shortly after on 1 August 2014 to \"assure the Sahel nations' security, and in effect France's security\".[43]\n\nIn 2022 Russian mercenaries from the Wagner Group were deployed in Mali,[44][45] as well as soldiers from the Russian regular army[citation needed]. At the same time, Turkish intervention had intensified[citation needed].\n\nInsurgency spreading to other countries [ edit ]\n\nNiger [ edit ]\n\nNiger faces jihadist insurgencies both in its western regions (as a result of the spillover of the Mali War) and in its southeastern region (as a result of the spillover of the Islamic insurgency in Nigeria). The insurgency in the west of the country began with incursions in 2015 and intensified from 2017 onwards. Since 2021, attacks were carried out with greater frequency in the country. In 2023 a successful coup was carried out, leading to the creation of a military junta and the start to an international crisis.\n\nBurkina Faso [ edit ]\n\nThe insurgency in the Sahel spread to Burkina Faso in 2015, beginning with an attack on a gendarme by alleged Boko Haram members. In 2016, the amount of attacks spiked after a new group, Ansarul Islam was founded by imam Ibrahim Malam Dicko.\n\nSince 2021, the insurgency in Burkina Faso has begun to spread to neighboring countries of Ivory Coast, Ghana, Benin and Togo. On 8 February 2022, insurgents attacked the W National Park in Benin, killing nine people. On 11 May 2022, militants crossed the border into Togo and killed eight soldiers.[46]\n\n2020s [ edit ]\n\nBeginning in the early 2020s, numerous coups were staged in countries in the Sahel, namely the 2020 and 2021 coups in Mali, in Guinea, Chad, Sudan, Burkina Faso and Niger. The coups further complicated the situation in the region.\n\nOn 21 January 2025, Niger, Burkina Faso and Mali decided to create a joint armed force of 5,000 soldiers to fight regional jihadism in the Sahel.[47]\n\nBoko Haram and ISWAP insurgency [ edit ]\n\nHaving cooperated and trained alongside AQIM in the Sahel since 2006, the Nigerian Islamist group Boko Haram began expanding into Chad and Niger in 2014 after successfully seizing territory in the insurgency in Nigeria.[48] By then controlling a significant area around Lake Chad, a coalition of Western African countries launched an offensive against the group in January 2015.[49] The group eventually ended its alliance with al-Qaeda, pledging allegiance to ISIL in March 2015. By the end of 2015 Boko Haram had been largely pushed to retreat into the Sambisa Forest in Nigeria, although attacks have continued including in Niger.[50][51]\n\nTimeline [ edit ]\n\n2012 [ edit ]\n\nJanuary 16 – The start of the Mali civil war.\n\n2013 [ edit ]\n\nMay 23 – Twin suicide attacks occur in Niger targeting a military base in Agadez and a uranium mine in Arlit.\n\n2014 [ edit ]\n\nDecember 11 – French troops in Mali killed top Islamist commander Ahmed al Tilemsi.

In Mali and Burkina Faso, both countries lost significant control of their territory to the Islamists. The conflict has also seen a political shift in the region, with many military juntas, many having recently overthrown US- and Chinese-backed governments, allying themselves with the Russian government and the Wagner Group.[389]\n\nIn particular, Mali has seen significant activity of the Wagner Group as the government moved closer to Turkey and Russia. Niger saw its government being overthrown in 2023 due to poor management of the conflict. In particular, the M62 Movement, a pro-Russian group, supported the coup. Burkina Faso also saw its government being overthrown twice within a year, with coups occurring in January and September, both of which caused by poor management of the conflict against Islamists. As a result of Russian expansion, Ukraine had funded opposition groups.[389]\n\nAlthough not affected as much, countries nearby like Ghana, Benin, Guinea, Togo and the Ivory Coast have been under constant threat of either full-on insurgency or severe destabilization internally. Guinea has already seen a coup d'état while the Gambia has seen turmoil internally. Northern Benin has seen an increase in terrorism attributed to Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin and the Islamic State, with 28 incidents attributed to the groups between 1 November 2021 and 14 September 2022, including the W National Park massacre.[390]\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nNotes [ edit ]",

        "title": "The Shifting Front of Militant Islamist Violence in the Sahel – Africa Center",
        "link": "https://africacenter.org/spotlight/militant-islamist-violence-sahel/",
        "description": "The Sahel has held the designation of the most lethal theater of militant Islamist violence in Africa for 4 years in a row. The Sahel accounted for 55 percent of all such fatalities, costing the lives of 10,400 people out of a total of 18,900 deaths continentally. An estimated 67 percent of all non-combatants killed by militant Islamist groups in Africa are in the Sahel.\n\nThree Sahelian countries—Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger—are the focal point of militant Islamist violence in the region. This violence has widened in scale and scope in recent years. Fatalities linked to these groups are more than two and half times the levels seen in 2020 when the first military coup in Mali occurred. Subsequent coups in Burkina Faso and Niger have also been followed by deteriorating security. Militant Islamist groups control more territory and transportation arteries in the three countries than at any point since the insurgencies began more than a decade ago. These figures are likely an undercount as the military juntas in all three countries have systematically intimidated journalists for reporting on military setbacks.\n\nThe widening security threat in the Sahelian countries is resulting in growing pressure on the neighboring coastal West African countries of Benin, Togo, Ghana, Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea, Senegal, and Mauritania.\n\nMilitant Islamist violence in the Sahel is not uniform but marked by concurrent patterns of expansion, plateau, and modest reductions. The divergent trends merit deeper analysis to better understand the focal points, actors, and objectives of the different extremist groups driving this violence.\n\nMultiple Groups, Multiple Agendas\n\nThe threat from militant Islamist groups in the Sahel is multidimensional with distinct groups each operating with their own unique leadership, organizational structure, objectives, fundraising, recruitment, and tactics. In 2017, several of these militant groups with affiliations to al Qaeda joined a coalition called Jama’at Nusrat al Islam wal Muslimeen (JNIM) to coordinate their activities and shield the composite entities from scrutiny.\n\nJNIM’s most active group is the Maçina Liberation Front (FLM) led by the charismatic Fulani preacher Amadou Koufa. As it has consolidated its grip on territory around its stronghold in central Mali, the FLM has used this base as a launching pad to expand into southern Mali and Burkina Faso. This includes a high-profile attack on a gendarmerie base in the capital city of Bamako in September 2024, in which dozens of soldiers were killed and the presidential plane set on fire.\n\nOther JNIM contingents, like Ansaroul Islam and Katiba Hanifa, have sustained their activities in northern and eastern Burkina Faso, consolidating their positions there and expanding further south into the border areas of Togo and Benin.\n\nMilitant Islamist groups first gained a foothold in the Sahel in northern Mali two decades ago with the emergence of fighters from al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), who had been operating in Algeria. Building on this growing influence, a Tuareg leader from Kidal, Iyad ag Aghali, founded Ansar Dine in 2011. Ansar Dine subsequently became a founding member of JNIM, with ag Ghali recognized as its official emir.\n\nAnother AQIM offshoot led by Abu al Bara al Sahrawi rebranded itself as the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS) in 2015, pledging allegiance to the Islamic State. Building on its de facto territorial control in the northern Malian region of Ménaka (which was consolidated after the withdrawal of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) in December 2023), ISGS has increased its violent attacks in western Niger where fatalities have jumped 66 percent (to 1,318 deaths) over the last year. ISGS militants have also maintained their pressure around the northern Malian city of Gao and the Oudalan and Séno Provinces of northern Burkina Faso where they have at times clashed with JNIM-affiliated militants. The concentration of ISGS activities in this area suggests a carving out of territory by ISGS from JNIM, with ISGS operating as the main actor in Ménaka and western Niger.\n\nSifting through these competing actors and areas of influence, three broad patterns of militant Islamist violence in the Sahel emerge:\n\nZones of rising militant Islamist group violence\n\nZones of militant Islamist group entrenchment\n\nThreats to the border areas of coastal West African countries\n\nClick for printable high-resolution PDF.\n\nZones of Rising Militant Islamist Violence\n\nZones of rising militant Islamist violence account for 42 percent of the fatalities observed in the Sahel over the past year. Three distinct areas stand out.\n\nCentral Mali and Boucle du Mouhoun, Burkina Faso [ See ● dots on Zone Map ]\n\nFLM remains most deeply entrenched in Central Mali and the neighboring region of Boucle du Mouhoun in northwest Burkina Faso. FLM has mobilized recruitment by exploiting economic and political tensions between pastoralist and farming communities in central Mali. FLM targets Fulani youth by presenting itself as sympathetic to the pastoralists’ grievances.\n\nAs FLM militants have pushed into Burkina Faso, they have engaged in livestock theft, the burning of villages, and destruction of bridges, further impoverishing and displacing communities that have resisted their presence. This is part of a trend in which the FLM has established itself through violence and, in the process, gained control of greater swathes of territory, transportation arteries, and economic activity.\n\nThe central Malian regions of Segou and Mopti saw more violent events (605) and fatalities (1,557) than in any previous year.\n\nThe 38-percent increase in fatalities registered in the Boucle du Mouhoun Region of Burkina Faso (resulting in 1,199 deaths) reflected the largest year-on-year increase of any region in the country. In the year prior to Burkina Faso’s two military coups in 2022, Boucle du Mouhoun reported 58 fatalities.\n\nConsidering Boucle du Mouhoun, Mopti, and Segou, there has been a 165-percent increase in fatalities (from 1,038 to 2,756) linked to militant Islamist groups from 2021 to 2024.\n\nRoughly 1 out of every 3 fatalities linked to militant Islamist groups in Mali and Burkina Faso took place in either Boucle du Mouhoun, Mopti, or Segou in 2024.\n\nAs FLM expands southward from Central Mali and Boucle du Mouhoun into southwest Burkina Faso, it poses a growing threat to Bobo Dioulasso—Burkina Faso’s second largest city (with a population of 1.2 million) and economic hub in the subregion. Taking territory surrounding Bobo Dioulasso would enable FLM to link up its core contingent of forces with FLM-affiliated fighters already established in Burkina Faso’s southwest near the border with Côte d’Ivoire. This would also place FLM in a position to push westward toward Bamako and the border with Guinea.\n\nVanguard FLM Force on the Ivorian Border [See ● dots in southwestern Burkina Faso on Zone Map] An offshoot group of FLM-linked militants has entrenched itself around the Dida Forest in southwestern Burkina Faso’s Cascades Region since 2019. These militants have struggled to establish a foothold in northern Côte d’Ivoire, but they have tapped into smuggling and trafficking networks as well as artisanal mining sites in the area. Led by a commander using the nom de guerre “Hamza,” this militant Islamist group has recruited from marginalized populations, intermixed with criminal actors, and established ongoing revenue streams that have made the violent extremists more self-reliant.\n\nFLM is also using its base in central Mali and Boucle du Mouhoun to stage more attacks into southern Mali. FLM’s expansion into this region represents an alarming development given that 60 percent of Malian citizens reside in southern Mali. The region is also the agricultural heart of the country, where cotton cultivation provides livelihoods for over 4 million people, roughly 20 percent of the population. Southern Mali is also the area in which most industrial scale mining occurs, making it strategically important to the country’s economy. Gold dominates Mali’s mining sector, representing more than 90 percent of the country’s mineral production. Deposits of diamonds, rock salt, phosphates, semi-precious stones, bauxite, iron ore, and manganese are also mined in this region. Taken together, Mali’s top two exports, gold and cotton, make up around 80 percent of export earnings in Mali’s economy. The deteriorating security situation in southern Mali, therefore, portends mounting disruptions for the country.\n\nBamako suffered a major attack in September 2024 when FLM forces hit a gendarmerie school, resulting in the loss of dozens of soldiers. The past year saw nearly triple the number of violent events occurring within 150 km of Bamako compared to 4 years ago.\n\nNo other zone in the Sahel recorded a sharper increase in militant Islamist group activity than southern Mali in the past year, with fatalities linked to violent events jumping by 87 percent (from 168 to 314).\n\nThe geographically strategic location of western Niger—abutting both central Mali and eastern Burkina Faso—makes it a highly influential zone of control for militant Islamist groups. Since the July 2023 military coup in Niamey, violent events and associated fatalities have dramatically increased in this zone as both JNIM and ISGS carve out their areas of influence in Niger.\n\nJNIM affiliates Ansaroul Islam and Katiba Hanifa have targeted the commercial corridors facilitating trade between Ouagadougou and Niamey. Building on its base in Mali’s Ménaka Region, ISGS has also rapidly expanded its control of territory in western Niger since the coup. ISGS has mounted increasingly lethal attacks in the Tillaberi Region. This has enabled ISGS to severely disrupt northbound transportation between Niamey and Gao in Mali.\n\nISGS and Ansaroul Islam are both also targeting different sections of the primary westbound artery from Niamey to Djibo in Burkina Faso. Meanwhile, a recently emerged shadowy JNIM group referred to as Katiba Hanifa disrupts a major commercial transit route that connects Niamey to Ouagadougou through the eastern city of Fada N’Gourma. These developments present a growing security and economic threat to Niamey as it finds itself increasingly encircled by the two extremist factions.\n\nISGS has also entrenched itself in areas of northern Burkina Faso in Oudalan and Seno Provinces where the borders of Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger meet. The collective effect of these escalations is a steadily deteriorating security situation in western Niger.\n\nFatalities linked to militant Islamist violence in western Niger have increased 66 percent from 793 in 2023 to 1,318 in 2024. These fatalities represent a marked increase in lethality as the number of violent events increased only marginally from 230 to 243 over the same period.\n\nNiger’s Tillaberi Region, which borders both Burkina Faso and Mali, recorded 92 percent of the fatalities (1,212) linked to militant Islamist groups (primarily ISGS and Ansaroul Islam ) in western Niger in 2024.\n\n) in western Niger in 2024. Long focused on Ménaka in northern Mali, ISGS is now linked to roughly the same number of violent events in western Niger (145) as in northern Mali (149). By stretching its influence southward both west and east of Niamey, ISGS militants may be seeking to encircle the Nigerien capital while also gaining control over supply routes to northwest Nigeria.\n\nJNIM (likely Ansaroul Islam), meanwhile, has been expanding its violent activity in western and southwestern Niger. It was linked to 598 fatalities in 2024, a 237-percent increase over the previous year.\n\nRoughly 90 percent of these JNIM-linked attacks in western Niger were concentrated in two areas: the region bordering eastern Burkina Faso and the border areas of northern Benin. The latter attacks are likely linked to Katiba Hanifa.\n\nClick for printable high-resolution PDF.\n\nAreas of Militant Islamist Group Entrenchment—Northern Mali and Northern Burkina Faso [ See ● dots on Zone Map ]\n\nSeveral regions of the Sahel saw either plateauing figures of militant Islamist group violence or modest abatements. For example, northern Mali and northern Burkina Faso, excluding Boucle du Mouhoun, saw slight declines in the number of violent events and fatalities from the record levels of violence experienced in 2023. Rather than an improving security situation, however, these plateaus appear to reflect the entrenchment of control over these northern territories where JNIM (likely Ansar Dine and Ansaroul Islam) and ISGS have long maintained a presence. These zones of entrenchment account for 48 percent of the fatalities in the Sahel, underscoring the sustainment of a high degree of militant Islamist violent activity.\n\nIn northern Mali, where Ansar Dine has been operating for two decades, militants closely linked to Iyad ag Aghali are able to control main thoroughfares and road arteries. Deadly attacks are so common that civilians are forced to rely on military escort, though these convoys are routinely ambushed by militants. The sparsely populated countryside and challenging terrain offer safe haven to the militants who have besieged dozens of urban centers.\n\nIn northern Burkina Faso, JNIM-affiliated Ansaroul Islam led by Jafar Dicko has entrenched itself around the city of Djibo. This area of Burkina Faso, comprising the Nord, Sahel, and Centre-Nord Regions, suffered more than 25 percent (2,674) of all fatalities in the Sahel theatre.\n\nNorthern Burkina Faso has also seen multiple incidents in which militants have killed hundreds of civilians and soldiers in single attacks over the past year. In June 2024, likely Ansaroul Islam militants killed more than 100 soldiers in an attack on a military base in Mansila in the Sahel Region of northeastern Burkina Faso. In Centre-Nord Region, militants attacked Barsalogho residents who were digging defensive trenches under the supervision of soldiers and Volunteers for the Defense of the Homeland (VDP) militiamen. Some 400 civilians were believed to be killed in this August 2024 attack. In the same month, suspected Ansaroul Islam militants ambushed a food supply convoy under security force escort in Est Region and killed roughly 150 soldiers and allied militiamen as well as dozens of civilians. These events are among the worst single-day fatality events ever recorded in Burkina Faso’s history.\n\nFrom its base in northern Burkina Faso, Ansaroul Islam has been able to expand south and east, linking up with Katiba Hanifa in southeastern Burkina Faso while also placing growing pressure on Ouagadougou.\n\nIn the tri-border zone between Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger contested by Ansaroul Islam and ISGS, civilians and security forces have come under persistent attack. Attacks on Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) health workers have led the humanitarian organization to suspend its activities in multiple locations in this region including Djibo in northern Burkina Faso and Ménaka in northern Mali. In Ménaka, ISGS has effectively besieged several municipalities to assert its de facto control over the territory. This has resulted in a 28-percent increase in the number of displaced persons in the region and an 85-percent increase in the number of refugees fleeing Ménaka for Niger over the last year.\n\nBlockades by ISGS, FLM, Ansaroul Islam, and Ansar Dine around Kidal and Timbuktu have pushed regions of northern Mali and northern Burkina Faso into emergency levels of food insecurity, causing millions to suffer acute hunger. Throughout the region, dozens of municipalities remain under siege, making it difficult for food and other necessities to reach a growing population of forcibly displaced persons.\n\nIn short, even in parts of the Sahel where the recorded events of violence have plateaued or decreased in aggregate, high levels of instability persist.\n\nThreats to Coastal West Africa [ See ● dots on Zone Map ]\n\nThe continued expansion of militant Islamist violence in Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger has resulted in an increased number of attacks along and beyond the borders of coastal West African countries, from Mauritania to Nigeria. Most attention has focused on Benin and Togo, which have respectively suffered 153 and 96 militant Islamist group-linked fatalities in 2024. However, there have also been dozens of violent extremist attacks in southern Mali within 50 km of the borders of Mauritania, Senegal, and Guinea. Until recently, these border zones reported little to no activity.\n\nFatalities linked to militant Islamist group violence within 50 km of or over the borders of coastal West Africa increased 27 percent from 1,601 to 2,036 between 2023 and 2024. This is even though violent events in the same zone dropped slightly from 455 to 449 over the same period.\n\nThe most notable increase occurred in Mali, where the number of fatalities linked to militant Islamist groups within 50 km of the border with Mauritania, Senegal, and Guinea shot up from 23 in 2023 to 125 in 2024.\n\nMeanwhile in southwestern Burkina Faso, JNIM-affiliated militants sustained their threat on the border of northern Côte d’Ivoire. Fatalities linked to these groups increased 27 percent from 267 to 361 in 2024.\n\nPressure on coastal West African countries has been particularly pronounced in the borderlands and jointly protected areas like the WAP parklands, which includes territory from Benin, Burkina Faso, and Niger and is near Togo, Ghana, and Nigeria. The parks’ transboundary location amplifies the complexity this security challenge poses for regional cooperation.\n\nJNIM-affiliate Katiba Hanifa has established itself in southeastern Burkina Faso since 2018. The militants use safe havens in the WAP parklands to infiltrate Benin and Togo while simultaneously expanding west in Burkina Faso along the border with Togo and Ghana.\n\nKatiba Hanifa targets some of the major commercial transit corridors for the region, seeking to exploit and cut off trade flow from coastal ports in Cotonou and Lomé. In 2024, militants heavily targeted both road networks and key border crossings, like Gaya in Niger. This poses a serious threat to Niamey. The Cotonou corridor handles more than 50 percent of Niger’s trade, with an additional 20 percent of Niger’s imports passing through Burkina Faso along routes that Katiba Hanifa has similarly targeted.\n\nIn addition to disrupting trade and tapping into the adjacent smuggling and trafficking networks, the militant Islamists have sought to exploit artisanal gold mining sites around the W-Arly-Pendari (WAP) reserve. The parklands are also an important area for pastoralists moving their herds to markets in coastal West Africa or seeking pasture on which to graze their livestock. Katiba Hanifa militants regularly extort livestock herders who move through and around the parklands, adding another important revenue stream to their activities.\n\nAs Katiba Hanifa expands westward from its base in southeast Burkina Faso it poses a growing threat to the northern borders of Ghana. Should Katiba Hanifa be able to expand westward across southern Burkina Faso, JNIM-affiliated militants would effectively surround Ouagadougou.\n\nFatalities linked to militant Islamist groups (likely Katiba Hanifa) in Burkina Faso’s Est Region—which includes the WAP complex and borders Niger, Benin, and Togo—nearly tripled in the last 2 years to 1,472 deaths.\n\nIn the Centre-Est Region of Burkina Faso, bordering Togo and Ghana, there was a 266-percent increase in fatalities (to 612 deaths) in the same time span.\n\nThe continued southward and westward push of militant Islamist groups is heightening the pressure on the borders of all the coastal West African countries. This will require the redoubling of proactive security and governance outreach measures in the northern regions of these countries to mitigate this threat and hold the line.",

        "description": "AFRICA\n\nWest Africa and the Sahel\n\nExpected Council Action\n\nIn April, the Security Council will hold a briefing on West Africa and the Sahel. The Special Representative and Head of the UN Office for West Africa and the Sahel (UNOWAS), Leonardo Santos Simão, is expected to brief.\n\nKey Recent Developments\n\nOn 29 January, Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger formally withdrew from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), concluding a year-long process following their announcement in 2024 of their intention to leave the sub-regional bloc. The three countries, led by military juntas that seized power through coups d’état, established the l’Alliance des États du Sahel (Alliance of Sahel States, or AES) in September 2023 as an organisation of collective defence. In March, the AES countries announced their withdrawal from Organization Internationale de la Francophonie (International Organisation of Francophonie), an organisation that promotes the French language and fosters cooperation among French-speaking nations.\n\nIn a communiqué adopted at the conclusion of its 66th Ordinary Session in Abuja in December 2024, the ECOWAS Authority of Heads of State and Government established a transitional period until 29 July, during which the three countries could rejoin the bloc. Moreover, it directed the Council of Ministers to convene an Extraordinary Session in the second quarter of 2025 to determine the modalities of separation and to develop a contingency plan outlining the future political and economic relations between ECOWAS and the AES states.\n\nThe rise of terrorism and violent extremism continues to undermine security and stability in the Sahel. The region remains a hotspot for extremist groups, including al-Qaida affiliates and factions linked to the Islamic State and the Levant, which exploit weak governance, intercommunal tensions, and economic hardships to expand their influence and destabilise local communities. According to the 2025 Global Terrorism Index (GTI), published by the Institute for Economics and Peace, the Sahel accounted for 19 percent of all terrorist attacks worldwide and 51 percent of global terrorism-related deaths in 2024, up from 48 percent in 2023. Five of the ten countries most affected by terrorism are in the Sahel.\n\nOn 21 March, Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS) militants attacked the Fambita Mosque in southwestern Niger, killing at least 44 people and setting fire to a market and several homes. Council members condemned the attack in a 27 March press statement.\n\nBeyond the Sahel, terrorist activity is increasing in coastal West Africa, with Benin and Togo witnessing an increase in attacks. Togo recorded ten attacks resulting in 52 deaths in 2024, with Jama’at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin (JNIM) claiming responsibility for four of these attacks, which accounted for 41 fatalities—up from 12 in 2023. The group also claimed responsibility for three attacks in Benin last year. In early January, terrorist attacks claimed by JNIM in northern Benin, near its border with Burkina Faso and Niger, resulted in the deaths of 28 Beninese soldiers. The attacks were strongly condemned by Council members in a 24 January press statement.\n\nSeveral countries in West Africa are undergoing political transitions and preparing for key elections in 2025. In Guinea, the military junta led by Colonel Mamady Doumbouya, which seized power in a 2021 coup, agreed with ECOWAS on a ten-point roadmap for civilian rule and elections by late 2024. However, delays, lack of transparency, and insufficient funding have hindered progress. The junta’s announcement of a constitutional referendum in the first half of 2025 has raised tensions, with the opposition accusing the junta of undermining the transition and escalating crackdowns on dissent.\n\nOn 26 March, Niger’s military leader General Abdourahamane Tchiani, who seized power in a coup d’état in July 2023, was sworn in as president for a five-year transition period under a new charter that replaces the country’s constitution. He was also promoted to the country’s highest military rank of an army general and signed a decree dissolving all political parties. The new charter reportedly states that the five-year transition period is “flexible” and may be adjusted based on the country’s security situation.\n\nCôte d’Ivoire is set to hold presidential elections on 25 October. President Alassane Ouattara is currently serving a third term, which the opposition claims violates the constitution’s two-term limit. Tensions escalated on 17 March when the electoral commission released the provisional voter list, excluding former President Laurent Gbagbo, former Prime Minister Guillaume Soro, and former Minister Charles Blé Goudé. Their disqualification, reportedly due to past criminal convictions, has sparked accusations of political exclusion, with opposition figures expected to challenge the decision.\n\nIn Togo, constitutional amendments introduced in 2024 are set to take effect on 6 May, transitioning the country from a presidential to a parliamentary system and consolidating executive authority under President Faure Gnassingbé, who will assume the new executive position of “President of the Council of Ministers”. These changes, which allow him to extend his rule indefinitely as long as his party maintains parliamentary control, have sparked controversy. Gnassingbé has been in power since 2005, following the death of his father, President Gnassingbé Eyadéma.\n\nGuinea-Bissau’s presidential and legislative elections are scheduled for 30 November; however, the country has been embroiled in political turmoil. President Umaro Sissoco Embaló dissolved parliament in December 2023 following an alleged coup attempt and postponed elections originally planned for 2024. While the opposition contends that Embaló’s term ended on 27 February, the Supreme Court ruled that it extends until 4 September, the date it validated his victory in 2020. ECOWAS’ efforts to mediate have faltered, with a joint ECOWAS-UNOWAS diplomatic mission, deployed from 21 to 28 February, forced to leave on 1 March after Embaló threatened its expulsion, rejecting regional interference. The opposition’s boycott of the joint mission, citing bias, further hindered mediation.\n\nKey Issues and Options\n\nThe rise of terrorism in West Africa and the Sahel region—particularly in the AES countries, which have been the epicentre of intensified terrorist attacks in the region—is a major concern for Council members. Over the years, terrorist groups have become more aggressive, leveraging increasingly sophisticated weaponry, including drones. The terrorist threat has progressively spread southward toward coastal states, raising alarm about potential spillover into previously unaffected regions. The growing link between terrorism and maritime crime is also a challenge that threatens to further destabilise the region.\n\nAnother significant issue for Council members is how to support the regional counter-terrorism security mechanisms—such as the Accra Initiative and the Multinational Joint Task Force in the Lake Chad basin—in countering this threat. These mechanisms grapple with formidable challenges, including political instability, fragmented security coordination, and persistent funding deficits. Compounding these difficulties has been the withdrawal of Western military assistance, coupled with a shift toward alternative security partnerships—most notably with Russia.\n\nCouncil members have also been concerned about the resurgence of unconstitutional changes of government, and they continue to closely follow ongoing political transitions in Burkina Faso, Guinea, Mali, and Niger. In this connection, addressing structural conflict drivers in the Sahel, such as poor governance, under-development, and climate change, remains a major issue.\n\nOne option for the Council would be to request a briefing from the Secretary-General on possible avenues for enhancing security and governance in the Sahel region. He could brief Council members on the outcome of the assessment by the Independent High-level Panel on Security, Governance and Development in the Sahel (that is, the Issoufou Panel). The Panel was jointly launched by the UN, the African Union, ECOWAS, and the Group of Five for the Sahel Joint Force (FC-G5S) in September 2022 under the leadership of the former president of Niger, Mahamadou Issoufou, to undertake a strategic assessment of “the underlying challenges in the Sahel, including the surge in violent extremism, growing fragility of the economies of the region due to the impact of climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as complex political transitions”. The Panel’s report was discussed at the 8th UN-AU annual conference in October 2024, but Council members have not had the opportunity to be briefed about the report.\n\nCouncil members may further consider organising an informal briefing to examine the inter-linkages between terrorism and maritime crime in the region, along with their implications for regional peace and security. The briefing could also address the growing use of sophisticated technology by terrorist groups in the region. The Council could also be briefed on security threats posed by climate change and the role of youth in addressing key regional challenges, including conflict, environmental changes, and political instability. This would offer an opportunity for Council members to gain a deeper understanding of these issues and explore potential strategies for addressing them effectively.\n\nThe humanitarian crisis in the Sahel and Lake Chad Basin, along with human rights violations by state and non-state actors, are also a major concern. Additionally, several Council members are troubled by ongoing restrictions on civic space and other human rights abuses. Council members could use the briefing as an opportunity to underscore the need for countries in the region to uphold international humanitarian and human rights law.\n\nCouncil Dynamics\n\nThere is broad concern in the Council about the threat of terrorism and the dire humanitarian crises affecting West Africa and the Sahel. However, Council discussion on this region has been increasingly divisive in recent years. The US and European members are worried about Russia’s growing influence in the region and its ties with the military juntas. While Russia supports the views of the AES countries in the Council, several members are concerned about developments in these countries. Sierra Leone, a West African country, and several other members believe it is important for the Council to maintain attention on the region, including how it might support regional efforts to combat the threat of terrorism and violent extremism.\n\nA significant trend shaping regional dynamics in the Sahel is the growing political divide between Sahelian countries and Western powers, coupled with increasing reliance on non-traditional military partnerships, including mercenary groups like the Africa Corps (formerly Wagner Group), to combat insurgencies and consolidate power. In late 2024, Côte d’Ivoire and Senegal requested the withdrawal of French military forces from their respective territories, reflecting a pivotal shift in a region where France has long maintained a military presence.\n\nThe wars in Ukraine and Syria have also had implications for the Sahel. In 2024, reports surfaced that Ukraine’s intelligence agency played a role in an ambush targeting Malian forces and Russia’s Wagner Group, resulting in heavy casualties. Ukrainian intelligence later acknowledged its involvement. The attack reportedly involved Tuareg rebels and JNIM militants. In response, the AES countries severed diplomatic ties with Ukraine. In August 2024, Ukraine’s incursion into Russia’s Kursk region reportedly prompted Russia to recall around 100 paramilitary personnel from Burkina Faso to reinforce its domestic defences.\n\nThe collapse of Assad’s government in Syria in December 2024 disrupted Russia’s logistical operations, as it had relied on Syrian military bases as a key hub for its activities in Africa. In response, Russia shifted military assets from Syria to other regions, including eastern Libya. At the same time, it strengthened its military partnership with Mali’s junta, delivering over 100 military assets earlier this year, including armoured vehicles, tanks, and weapon systems, reinforcing its influence in the Sahel.\n\nDenmark and Sierra Leone are co-penholders on UNOWAS.\n\nUN DOCUMENT ON WEST AFRICA AND THE SAHEL",

The operations room was declared in June 2019, evolving from the \"Damascus Conquest\" operations room formed in May,[5] during the Syrian Army's Dawn of Idlib 1 campaign,[6] and consists of rebel groups operating in opposition-held areas of northwestern Syria concentrated in Idlib.[7]\n\nThe three groups comprising the coalition are Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the Turkish-backed National Front for Liberation, and Jaysh al-Izza.[8] In October 2020, HTS and two leading factions from the NLF began to finalize the creation of a Unified Military Council in Idlib.[9][10]\n\nIn December 2024, the alliance launched an offensive which resulted in the collapse of the Assad-led government and a new transitional government led by senior figures from Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham.

The first operation, \"Defeating the aggression.\" had resulted in the rebels seizing several towns and positions.[12]\n\nFirst northwestern Syria offensive [ edit ]\n\nPro-rebel sources reported the factions hit a RuAF SU-22.[13] On 8 June, al-Fateh al-Mubin operations room advanced into several areas north of Hama and cut the road between the town of Maharda and Skaylbia.[14] A faction in the coalition also reportedly damaged a SyAAF Aero L-39 Albatros, forcing it to land.[13]\n\nOn 16 June, the Syrian Observatory on Human Rights (SOHR), a UK-based monitor, reported that the factions repulsed an attack on their positions at the Tal Meleh axis.[15]\n\nOn 18 June, the operations room carried out an attack on the Tal Meleh axis. Syrian state media reporting they halted the attack.[16] The Syrian Army, in turn, declared the start of an operation to recapture the towns of Tal Meleh and Jubbayn 19 June.[17] by the 20th, 89 rebels and 41 government soldiers were dead. The factions were able to repel the attack.[18]\n\nOn 28 June 2019, the NLF carried out a raid on the town of al-Hawiz, reportedly killing 15 soldiers and injuring 30.[19] The same day, another L-39 was hit, forcing the aircraft to land.[20]\n\nOn 10 July 2019, the operations room captured the city of Hamamiyat and its hill.[21][6] Pro-government Al-Masdar News reported that the Syrian Army recaptured the town the following day.[22] It was reported the coalition also attacked several Syrian Army positions in areas of Latakia.[12]\n\nOn 20 July, the operations room repelled an attack on Jubbayn.[18]\n\nOn 21 July 2019, the operations room launched an attack on Qasabiyeh, but was repelled by the Syrian Army.[23]\n\nOn 28 July 2019, the operations room suffered major setbacks after the Syrian Army recaptured Tal Meleh and Jubbayn, reversing all their gains.[24][25] Sources reported dozens of pro-government fighters including senior generals were killed in clashes with the factions.[26]\n\nThe Fateh Mubin operations room lost several key areas including the strategic city of Khan Shaykhun[27] and was forced out of northern Hama. The battle ended with a ceasefire which came into effect on 31 August.[28]\n\nSecond northwestern Syria offensive [ edit ]\n\nIn December 2019, after renewed airstrikes on rebel-held areas, opposition sources announced the Syrian Army was planning to restart its Idlib offensive.[29] On 19 December, the Syrian Army began the offensive, advancing into several towns.[30] The armed factions were also attacked from the Aleppo axis. The city of Ma'arrat al-Nu'man was captured by the Syrian Army after weeks of bombing amidst an assault on 29 January 2020.[31] Turkey began sending convoys of troops and equipment into Idlib to safeguard against a complete takeover of the province.[32] The Fateh Mubin operations room lost several key cities including the city of Saraqib.[33] Following the reopening of the M5 highway to pro-government forces, the Syrian Army launched an attack on the Aleppo axis, seizing most rebel held areas of the province.[34] On 20 February, backed by Turkish artillery, the rebels launched an attack on the town of Neirab[35] and briefly captured the town, but withdrew after heavy clashes and airstrikes.[36] The rebel factions attempted another advance on the Neirab axis, recapturing the town and the city of Saraqib on 27 February.[37][38] On 1 March, the opposition factions also carried out a counterattack on the Al-Ghab Plain where the Syrian army had been advancing, halting the offensive there and retaking several towns.[39][40] Turkish drone strikes on the SAA and allies turned the tide of the battle in favor of the rebels on several fronts.[41] The city of Saraqib was recaptured by the SAA on 2 March 2020.[42] 3 days later, the battle ended as a ceasefire was agreed to by Turkey and Russia.[43]\n\nAftermath [ edit ]\n\nOn 24 June 2020, SOHR reported that the factions repelled an infiltration attempt by the Syrian Army on the Harsh Binin frontline. The Syrian army shelled rebel positions, while the Turkish Army shelled several positions of the Syrian Army in support of the rebels.[44]\n\nOn 25 June 2020, SOHR reported that the NLF repelled an infiltration attempt by the Syrian army on the Bayanin frontline. The Turkish army shelled several positions of the Syrian Army during the clashes.[45] The SOHR reported that the Syrian army attempted a third infiltration attempt back by artillery, but this attack was repulsed at well.[46]\n\nOn 26 June 2020, following a conflict with the Guardians of Religion Organization, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham declared Fateh Mubin the only legal coalition in rebel-held Idlib and barred the creation of any other military operation rooms.[47]\n\nOn 28 June 2020, SOHR reported that HTS destroyed a heavy machine gun of the Syrian Army in the al-Jaradah area.[48]\n\nOn 29 June 2020, SOHR reported that the factions shelled several Syrian Army positions in southern Idlib. They also repelled an attempt by the Syrian army to infiltrate the al-Fterah area,[49] and destroyed a military bulldozer on the Dadikh village frontline.[50]\n\nOn 30 June there were reports that the Syrian Army launched an attack and captured several positions on the Ruwaiha axis. A spokesman for the NLF denied the claim.[51]\n\nDuring early July 2020, SOHR reported clashes and shelling of positions between al-Fateh al-Mubin and pro-government forces took place, as the Syrian Army sent reinforcements to the front lines in Idlib.[52][53][54]\n\nOn 10 July 2020, SOHR reported that a Russian UAV was shot down by the NLF during fierce clashes in the Idlib countryside.[55]\n\nSkirmishes and clashes between the operations room and the Syrian Army continued over the course of the year, with the ceasefire agreed to in March regularly being broken with shelling and infiltration attempts.[56]\n\nOn 20 December 2020 the operations room repelled an infiltration attempt in Jabal al-Zawiya. Shelling took place between the two sides the following day.[57]\n\nOn 4 January 2021, the operations room clashed with the Syrian Army in the Jabal al-Zawiya area.[58]\n\nOn 7 January 2021 three soldiers from HTS were killed by Syrian Army shelling near the village of Fateira.[59] HTS reportedly destroyed two vehicles and killed a number of soldiers near Hantoutin village after attacking them with ATGM launchers. A Syrian soldier was shot by a sniper operating under the Fatah Mubin operations room coinciding with shelling by the latter near Dadikh village. The Syrian Army shelled rebel-held areas of Latakia governorate the same day.[60]\n\nOn 11 January 2021, a group of Syrian Army soldiers infiltrated positions of NLF group Jaysh al-Nasr in the town of Al-Ankawi during nighttime,[61] killing 11 fighters.[62][63] The NLF responded by shelling Syrian Army positions in northwest Hama and southern Idlib countrysides.[64]\n\nOperation Deterrence of Aggression and collapse of Assad regime [ edit ]\n\nNotes [ edit ]\n\n^ Arabic: إدارة العمليات العسكرية , romanized: iidarat aleamaliaat aleaskaria ^ Arabic: الفتح المُبين , lit.

        "description": "Ongoing military intervention in West Asia\n\nOn 22 September 2014, the United States officially intervened in the Syrian civil war with the stated aim of fighting the Islamic State (ISIL/ISIS) terrorist organization in support of the international war against it, code named Operation Inherent Resolve. The US currently continues to support the Syrian Free Army opposition faction and the YPG-led Syrian Democratic Forces.\n\nShortly after the start of the civil war in 2011, the Obama administration placed sanctions against Syria and supported the Free Syrian Army rebel faction by covertly authorizing Timber Sycamore under which the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) armed and trained rebels. Following the Islamic State's occupation of Eastern Syria in August 2014, the United States conducted surveillance flights in Syria to gather intelligence regarding the Islamic State. In September 2014, the United States-led coalition—which involves the United Kingdom, France, Jordan, Turkey, Canada, Australia, and others—launched an air campaign against the Islamic State and al-Nusra Front inside Syria.\n\nThe US missile strike on Shayrat Airbase on 7 April 2017 was the first time the US deliberately attacked Syrian government forces during the war,[168] and marked the start of a series of direct military actions by US forces against the Syrian government and its allies via airstrikes and aircraft shoot-downs, mainly in defense of either the Syrian Democratic Forces or the Syrian Free Army opposition group based in al-Tanf. In mid-January 2018, the Trump administration indicated its intention to maintain an open-ended military presence in Syria to accomplish US political objectives, including countering Iranian influence and ousting Syrian president Bashar al-Assad.[169][170] However, on 19 December, President Trump unilaterally ordered the withdrawal of the 2,000–2,500 US ground troops in Syria at the time, which was to be completed in 2019.[171][172][173] With proliferating concerns over a potential power vacuum, the US announced on 22 February 2019 that instead of a total withdrawal, a contingency force of around 400 US troops would remain garrisoned in Syria indefinitely, and that their withdrawal would be gradual and conditions-based, returning to a policy of open-ended American military presence in the country.[174][175]\n\nIn 2019, the coalition saw decisive results in its intervention against the Islamic State; the terror group lost its last remaining territory in Syria during the battle of Baghuz Fawqani[176] and its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi died during a US special forces raid in Idlib in October 2019.[177] The Trump administration ordered all US forces to withdraw from Rojava in early October ahead of a Turkish incursion into the region, a controversial move widely seen as a reneging of the US's alliance with the SDF in favor of NATO ally Turkey.[178] However, by November 2019, US troops instead repositioned to eastern Syria, reinforcing their presence in the al-Hasakah and Deir ez-Zor governorates, with the subordinate mission of securing SDF-controlled oil and gas infrastructure from the IS insurgency and the Syrian government.[179] On 23 November 2019, the head of US Central Command stated there was no \"end date\" on the US's intervention in Syria.[180]\n\nThe US Department of Defense stated that there were around 900 US soldiers operating in Syria as of February 2021.[49][181] On 19 December 2024, after the fall of the Assad regime, the Pentagon revealed that there were around 2,000 US troops in Syria, adding that the increase was temporary and occurred in recent months.[182]\n\nBackground [ edit ]\n\nLeaked United States diplomatic cables have been seen as showing that regime change in Syria may have been a covert foreign policy goal of the US government in the years leading up to the civil war, even during the period when President Barack Obama was publicly engaging with Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. A 2006 memorandum by US diplomat William Roebuck of the embassy in Damascus stated:\n\nWe believe Bashar's weaknesses are in how he chooses to react to looming issues, both perceived and real, such as...the potential threat to the regime from the increasing presence of transiting Islamist extremists. This cable summarizes our assessment of these vulnerabilities and suggests that there may be actions, statements and signals that the USG can send that will improve the likelihood of such opportunities arising. These proposals will need to be fleshed out and converted into real actions and we need to be ready to move quickly to take advantage of such opportunities. Many of our suggestions underline using Public Diplomacy and more indirect means to send messages that influence the inner circle.\n\nAccording to Seymour Hersh and activist Robert Naiman, Roebuck, who went on to be charge d'affairs of the Libyan embassy under Obama, also considered the advantages of promoting religious sectarianism in Syria.[183][184]\n\nFollowing the start of the Arab Spring in 2011, protests in Syria against the Assad regime were violently suppressed and a civil war began.[185] By 2012 there were several armed opposition groups operating in the country, including the Free Syrian Army, formed in July 2011 by officers who defected from the Syrian Armed Forces. In 2012, the al-Nusra Front, led by Abu Muhammad al-Julani, was established by the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI) as the official branch of al-Qaeda in Syria. The al-Nusra Front was eclipsed by its own creator, and al-Qaeda severed its ties to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in February 2014, after an eight-month power struggle.[186] Despite clear connections between ISI and the al-Nusra Front, the two organisations never merged during the Syrian Civil War, as al-Julani refused to cede control to ISI and insisted on maintaining al-Nusra Front as a separate entity.[187]\n\nShortly after the civil war broke out in 2011, the US initially supplied the rebels of the Free Syrian Army with non-lethal aid (e.g., food rations and pickup trucks), but quickly began providing training, money, and intelligence to selected Syrian rebel commanders. At least two US programs attempted to assist the Syrian rebels, including a 2014 Pentagon program that planned to train and equip 15,000 rebels to fight the IS, which was canceled in 2015 after spending $500 million and producing only a few dozen fighters.[188] A simultaneous $1 billion covert program called Timber Sycamore conducted by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) aimed at fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was more successful, but was decimated by Russian bombing, and canceled in mid-2017 by the Trump administration.[188] The Obama administration began surveillance missions on Islamic State positions in Syria in September 2014.[189] On 22 September 2014, the US, Bahrain, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) began to attack ISIL forces inside Syria,[190][191] as well as the Khorasan group in the Idlib Governorate west of Aleppo, and the al-Nusra Front around Raqqa,[31][192] as part of the international military intervention against ISIL.[190][193][194][195]\n\nTimber Sycamore and Syrian Train and Equip Program [ edit ]\n\nAt the direction of US President Barack Obama, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was put in charge of operations worth about $1 billion annually to arm anti-government forces in Syria,[196][197][198][199] an operation which formally began in 2013, more than two years after the start of the civil war in 2011. Prior to 2013, the CIA only supplied certain rebel groups of the Free Syrian Army with non-lethal aid, but later began providing training, funding, and intelligence to selected rebel commanders.[200][201][202] Although a former intelligence adviser who spoke to journalist Seymour Hersh claimed the CIA had been facilitating the flow of arms from Libya to Syria in collaboration with \"the UK [United Kingdom], Saudi Arabia and Qatar\" since 2012 or 2011,[203] the first confirmed CIA weapons arrived in Spring 2014: \"There were just a handful, delivered to only one rebel group carefully vetted by the CIA\". The group, Harakat Hazm, or the Steadfast Movement, showed off the new weapons system by posting the first successful strike on YouTube in April.[204] Another of the groups being vetted was the Islamist Army of Mujahedeen, formed in January 2014 specifically to combat ISIL.[204][205] However, there were indications that the Army of Mujahedeen was still being vetted in September 2014.[206]\n\nIn addition to the covert CIA program,[207] on 17 September 2014, the US House of Representatives voted to authorize the executive branch to overtly train and equip Syrian rebels against ISIL forces, at a cost of $500 million.[208][209]\n\nJuly 2014 rescue mission [ edit ]\n\nFollowing the abduction of a number of foreigners in Syria, on 4 July 2014, the US carried out an operation to rescue foreign hostages being held by ISIL. US airstrikes were conducted against an ISIL military base known as the \"Osama bin Laden Camp\" while at the same time, two dozen US special forces soldiers dropped from helicopters near an ISIL-held building, thought to be for high-value prisoners. No prisoners were found in the building and the soldiers were quickly engaged by ISIL forces dispatched from Raqqa, which started a three-hour firefight.[210] US forces concluded that the hostages were no longer at the site and abandoned the rescue attempt. At least five ISIL fighters were killed and one US soldier was wounded. Jordanian forces were also reportedly involved in the operation, with one Jordanian soldier reportedly wounded, but Jordanian involvement was not confirmed. Later on, it was reported that the hostages had been moved 24 hours before the attempted rescue.[210] Following the mission, it remained unclear whether the operation failed due to bad intelligence or whether ISIL forces were alerted in advance of the mission.[211]\n\nIn the aftermath of the rescue mission, and purportedly as a response to airstrikes in Iraq, ISIL beheaded three hostages over a one-month period: Americans James Foley[210] and Steven Sotloff on 19 August and 2 September, respectively,[citation needed] and Briton David Haines on 13 September.[212]\n\nSurveillance flights over Syria [ edit ]\n\nOn 26 August 2014, the US began conducting overt surveillance flights, including drones, over Syria to gather intelligence on ISIL targets. The flights began gathering intelligence that would aid future airstrikes even though airstrikes were not yet authorized at that point.[213] No approval was sought from the Assad government for flights entering Syrian airspace.[214]\n\nUS-led coalition against ISIL [ edit ]\n\nIn June 2014, the Iraqi government formally requested the United States to assist in its struggle against ISIL, following the group's offensive in northern Iraq that same month.[215] Since then, the US led efforts to establish a global coalition to counter ISIL.[216]\n\nIn response to this request, various sets of countries convened on 5 September, 15 September[217] and 3 December 2014, to discuss concerted action against ISIL. Present at all three meetings were the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, Turkey and Denmark.\n\nThe coalition of 5 September (10 countries) decided to support anti-ISIL forces in Iraq and Syria.[218] On 10 September 2014, US president Barack Obama announced a \"comprehensive\" strategy to counter ISIL that \"in concert with coalition partners [...] will defeat ISIL and deny them safe haven\".[219]\n\nThe coalition of 3 December 2014 (sixty countries) that styled itself as the Global Coalition to Counter the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)[220] agreed on a many-sided strategy against ISIL, including cutting off ISIL's financing and funding and exposing ISIL's true nature.[220] As of March 2015, the US-led coalition comprised over sixty countries, that contributed in various ways to the effort.[216]\n\nSupport for Kurdish-led ground forces [ edit ]\n\nAs the Siege of Kobanî continued there were growing calls to also arm the YPG, also known as the People's Protection Units, a Kurdish fighting force in Syria heavily involved in the defense of Kobanî.[221] On 20 October 2014, the Turkish foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu announced that the Turkish government would be allowing Peshmerga from the Iraqi Kurdistan Regional Government to cross their border into Kobanî to support Kurdish fighters.[222] The change in policy came after the Turkish government had refused to allow Kurdish fighters and supplies to pass through the border to YPG units in Kobanî, as it viewed the YPG as an offshoot of the PKK.[223] On 28 October, Peshmerga from the Iraqi Kurdistan Regional Government departed Erbil to travel to Turkey and eventually to Kobanî.[224] A total of 152 soldiers were deployed starting with forty vehicles carrying weapons, artillery, and machine guns, along with 80 Peshmerga forces, who crossed the border into Turkey by land with the heavy weapons and then drove to the border near Kobanî.[224] The other 72 soldiers in the contingent flew to Turkey and rejoined the rest of the contingent on 29 October.[224] By the start of November, 152 Kurdish Peshmerga from Iraq and 50 Free Syrian Army fighters had crossed the border into Kobanî with heavy weapons, small arms, and ammunition.[19][110]\n\nOn 20 October 2014, the United States began airdropping supplies to Syrian Kurdish forces, including the YPG, that were besieging ISIL-controlled Kobanî.[225] Prior to 20 October, the United States and its anti-ISIL coalition partners in Syria had not provided any supplies to Kurdish forces in their fight against the jihadist group.[225] Much of the reason for the US airdropping supplies was due to the Turkish government's refusal to allow supplies to pass through their border into Kobanî. The US specifically airdropped weapons, ammunition, and medical supplies supplied by Iraqi Kurdistan intended to supply the Kurdish forces in Syria.[225] On 21 October, a video was released by ISIL showing what it claimed was a bundle of airdropped small arms, ammunition, and other supplies from the United States. The Pentagon said it was analyzing the video and could not at the time confirm whether the video was authentic but that the materials were similar; the video would subsequently be analyzed by the Department of Defense to verify its authenticity.[226] On 22 October, the Pentagon confirmed that one of its airdrops had been intercepted by ISIL elements but downplayed the incident, saying that it most likely would not give ISIL any real advantage in their overall operations.[227]\n\nOn 8 December 2024, following the end of the Assad regime and takeover by the SDF and Syrian opposition, the United States Central Command announced renewed operations and air strikes against ISIL cells and targets within Syria.[228] US President Joe Biden called the regime change as a \"moment of risk\", and clarified that the operations were to ensure that ISIL did not take advantage of the circumstances.[citation needed]\n\nCoalition arming and training of the Syrian opposition [ edit ]\n\nIn October 2014, the Turkish government agreed to help train and equip some moderate Syrian rebels in Turkey.[229] By January 2015, the United States was set to send 400 troops and hundreds of support staff to countries neighboring Syria in order to train 5,000 opposition soldiers a year for the next three years.[230] The countries taking part in the train-and-equip program were to include Jordan, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, as well as Turkey.[231] The groups that were expected to be armed and trained by the US government included fighters from the Free Syrian Army.[232] The Pentagon confirmed that it had selected 1,200 Syrian opposition members to begin training in March 2015, with 3,000 to complete training by the end of 2015.[231]\n\nThe successful experience in Kobanî had informed US policy in regard to arming Syrian opposition groups other than the Kurdish YPG, with plans to give other groups technicals equipped with radio and GPS equipment to call in airstrikes.[207] John R. Allen, President Obama's envoy to the international coalition against ISIL, stated \"It is clearly part of our plan, that not only we will train them, and we will equip them with the latest weapons systems, but we will also protect them when the time comes\".[233] In March 2015, the United Kingdom announced that it was sending around 75 military instructors to train Syrian opposition forces.[234][235] The train-and-equip program started on 9 May 2015.[236] On 25 May, Turkey and the US agreed \"in principle\" on the necessity to support these forces with air support.[237]\n\nHowever, only about 200 rebel fighters actually began training, the majority of whom left after being required to agree to fight only against ISIL and not the Assad government.[238] By mid-2015, only a group of 54 such fighters (Division 30) had been deployed—which was quickly routed in an ambush by al-Nusra[239]—and a further 100 had been thus far finished training in Jordan.[240] In September 2015, it was reported that a further 100-120 were being trained in a second wave,[241] with 75 more Division 30 fighters reported to have re-entered Syria at the end of the month; they were immediately attacked by al-Nusra.[242]\n\nJane's Defence Weekly reported that in December 2015 the US shipped 994 tonnes of weapons and ammunition (including packaging and container weight), generally of Soviet-type equipment from Eastern Europe, to Syrian rebel groups under the ongoing CIA Timber Sycamore operation. A detailed list of weapon types and shipment weights had been obtained from the US government's Federal Business Opportunities website.[243][244] As of July 2016, extensive arms shipments were continuing.[245][246][247]\n\nIt was reported in July 2017 that the Donald Trump administration decided to \"phase-out\" the CIA program to equip and train anti-government rebel groups.[248][249][250]\n\nMultinational air war [ edit ]\n\nUSS Carl Vinson and support ships deployed for combat operations in Syria and Iraq, 2014\n\nContributing countries [ edit ]\n\nUS airstrikes [ edit ]\n\nAn F/A-18 Super Hornet taking off from USS Carl Vinson before carrying out strikes on ISIL targets in Syria\n\nIn his address to the nation on 10 September 2014, US President Obama announced his intention to bomb ISIL targets in Syria and called on Congress to authorize a program to train and arm rebels who were fighting ISIL and the Syrian forces of Bashar al-Assad.[257] For the first time, he authorized direct attacks against the militant group in Syria. In his address, he said the United States were going on offensive, launching \"a steady, relentless effort to take out\" the group \"wherever they exist.\" Obama also announced creating of a broader coalition against ISIL.[258]\n\nCommenting on Obama's address, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich [ru] opposed the US intervention against ISIL in Syria \"without the consent of the legitimate government\" and said that \"this step, in the absence of a UN Security Council decision, would be an act of aggression, a gross violation of international law\". Ali Haidar, Syrian minister of national reconciliation, said that \"any action of any kind without the consent of the Syrian government would be an attack on Syria\".[259]\n\nOn 17 September, the US House of Representatives approved Obama's plan to train and arm the Syrian rebels in their fight against ISIL. In a statement following the House vote, Obama said that the United States would not send military troops to Syria.[260] The Senate gave final congressional approval to Obama's proposal the next day.[261]\n\nThe US did not request permission from the Syrian government, nor did it coordinate its actions with the Syrian government, provide direct notification to the Syrian military or give indication of timing on specific targets, but it did notify the Syrian U.N. representative, which the Syrian government confirmed.[262]\n\nBefore the airstrikes began, the United States also informed Iran, the Assad government's largest regional ally, of their intention to launch airstrikes. It did not share specific timing or targets of strikes with the Iranian government but reportedly assured it that the US would not strike any Syrian government targets.[263]\n\nOn 8 April 2018, US President Donald Trump called Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad \"Animal Assad\", following suspected chemical attack carried out in the Syrian city of Douma.[264] On 14 April, the United States, France, and the United Kingdom carried out missile strikes against Syria. On 30 May, President Al-Assad responded to the insult, by saying: \"What you say is what you are.\"[265]\n\nIt was reported in June 2018 that the 441st Air Expeditionary Squadron reportedly maintained an unpaved runway in Sarrin, Raqqa Governorate.[266][267][268]\n\nOn 14 June 2020, a US coalition drone strike killed Guardians of Religion Organization leaders Khalid al-Aruri and Bilal al-Sanaani who were driving a vehicle in Idlib.[269] There was reportedly no explosion and the target vehicle was relatively intact, with the roof and windshield impacted from above and one side shredded, leading observers to suggest the munition used was probably the kinetic Hellfire R9X missile that uses blades to eviscerate its target rather than an explosive warhead.[270] On 24 June, Abu Adnan al-Homsi, logistics and equipment commander at the Guardians of Religion Organization, was also killed by a US drone strike.[271]\n\nOn 25 February 2021, US military airstrikes commanded by US president Joe Biden destroyed multiple facilities related to pro-Iranian militias including Kata'ib Hezbollah and Kata'ib Sayyid al-Shuhada, at a border control point near al-Hurri village, Abu Kamal District, in retaliation to Erbil missile attacks.[272][273] At least 17 militants were reported killed in the strikes, although the militias only confirmed one.[274] The strikes were conducted by two F15s dropping Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) and was the first overt military operation ordered by the Biden administration.[275]\n\nOn 28 June 2021, the US military conducted airstrikes on facilities purportedly used by Iranian-supported militias near the Iraq–Syria border.[276] However, the SOHR stated that at least nine Iran-backed Iraqi militia fighters died, and many others were injured.[277]\n\nAirstrikes on the Khorasan Group [ edit ]\n\nF/A-18 Hornets take off from USS George H.W. Bush to strike ISIL targets in Syria, 2014\n\nOne of the groups targeted by US airstrikes was the Khorasan Group, an extremist group of suspected al-Qaeda \"core\" members who were alleged to have been plotting an attack against the US and other Western nations.[262] The strikes targeted Khorasan training camps, explosives and munitions production facilities, communications facilities, as well as command and control facilities. The group has been claimed to possess advanced bomb making skills and their plot is claimed to involve a bomb made of a nonmetallic device such as a toothpaste container or clothes dipped in explosive material.[278] The group is reportedly led by Muhsin al-Fadhli, a leader of al-Qaeda and a close confidant of Osama bin Laden.[278] Intelligence officials expressed concern that the group may include militants who were taught by Ibrahim al-Asiri, the chief bomb maker for al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, who is known for his sophisticated bomb making techniques that nearly downed two Western airliners.[278]\n\nLater statements by government officials indicated that the threat of a plot may have been less severe than initially reported.[279][280] One official indicated that \"there did not yet seem to be a concrete plan in the works\",[279] while another told The Guardian that \"there was no indication of an imminent domestic threat from the group\" at the time the United States began bombing.[280]\n\nOn 6 November, a second round of airstrikes was launched against Khorasan and al-Nusra in northwestern Syria, along with Ahrar ash-Sham at its headquarters in Idlib, whose leadership had been infiltrated by al-Qaeda.[27] On 13 November 2014, the US launched a third set of airstrikes against Khorasan.[281] On 19 November, the US carried out another airstrike on Khorasan near Hazm, which struck and destroyed a storage facility associated with the group.[282] On 1 December, the US carried out another airstrike on Khorasan near Aleppo.[283]\n\nOn 24 March 2015, it was revealed that the US airstrikes on Khorasan had killed 17 militants from the group.[284]\n\nOn 8 July 2015, a US airstrike near the town of Sarmada in Idlib, Syria, killed Muhsin al-Fadhli, the leader of Khorasan.[93]\n\nGround operations [ edit ]\n\nInitially, coalition leaders, including US President Obama, said their ground forces would not be used in the fight against ISIL either in Iraq or Syria unless they were local coalition forces.[285] In Iraq, thousands of coalition troops from the US and other nations had been deployed in an advisory capacity; in Syria no ground troops from the coalition were deployed in the beginning of the intervention.[286][287]\n\nIn November 2015, the Obama administration began the deployment of US special forces to Syria, with the mission of assisting rebel forces in their fight against ISIL, President Obama then ordered several dozen Special Operations troops into Rojava in northern Syria to assist local fighters battling ISIL, authorizing the first open-ended mission by American ground forces into the country.[288]\n\nISIL's deputy leader in Syria, Abu Ali al-Anbari, was killed by JSOC special forces operatives in March 2016, in eastern Syria near the Syrian–Iraqi border, while he and three other ISIL members were traveling in a vehicle coming from Raqqa. The US Special Forces ordered him to exit the vehicle, intending to arrest him. When he refused and pulled out an assault rifle instead, US forces fired at the vehicle, killing him and the other passengers on board. US commandos also seized electronics and other documents during the operation for intelligence purposes.[289]\n\nIn March 2016, King Abdullah of Jordan said that British forces had helped in the building up of a mechanized battalion in southern Syria, consisting of tribal fighters to combat the Syrian Army.[290]\n\nOn 17 March 2016, the day after the declaration of the Federation of Northern Syria, US Defense Secretary Ashton Carter praised the Syrian Democratic Forces as having \"proven to be excellent partners of ours on the ground in fighting ISIL. We are grateful for that, and we intend to continue to do that, recognizing the complexities of their regional role.\"[291]\n\nDuring the SDF's May 2016 offensive against ISIL in Northern Raqqa, US Special Forces were widely reported and photographed to be present, with some of them wearing badges of the Kurdish YPG and YPJ on their uniforms.[292] On 21 May, Joseph Votel, commanding general of US Central Command, completed a secret hours-long trip to northern Syria to visit several locations where there were US special operations forces and meet with local forces the US was helping train to fight ISIL. The visit came as the first of 250 additional US special operations forces were beginning to arrive in Syria to work with local forces. The commander overseeing the war in Syria, at the end of a long Saturday spent touring SDF bases, said \"We do, absolutely, have to go with what we've got\".[293]\n\nIn September 2016, the US spokesman for the Combined Joint Task Force – Operation Inherent Resolve (CJTF–OIR) confirmed that the SDF, including the YPG, is also part of the \"vetted forces\" in the train and equip program and would be supplied with weapons. The President of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, condemned this and claimed that the SDF are \"endangering our future\".[294]\n\nIn October 2016, US Army Lt. Gen. Stephen J. Townsend, the commander of the international coalition against ISIL, said that the SDF would lead the impending assault on Raqqa, ISIL's then-stronghold and capital, and that SDF commanders would plan the operation with advice from American and coalition troops.[295] From November 2016, more than 300 US Special Operations Forces were embedded to train and advise SDF fighters in the Raqqa offensive.[296]\n\nKurdish troops and US armored vehicle in Al-Hasakah, May 2017\n\nUS Marines and Army Special Forces operating in support of the SDF in Syria, October 2018\n\nIn March 2017, the Trump administration deployed an additional 400 US Marines to Syria to expand the fight against ISIL in the Raqqa offensive where they could provide artillery support for US-backed local forces that were preparing an assault on Raqqa to liberate the city from IS militants. The deployment marked a new escalation in the US's war in Syria, and put more conventional US troops in the battle that, until then, had primarily used Special Operations units. The 400 Marines were part of the 11th MEU from the Battalion Landing Team 1st Battalion, 4th Marines. They manned an artillery battery of M-777 Howitzers whilst additional infantrymen from the unit provided security; resupplies were handled by part of the expeditionary force's combat logistics element.[297] During the Raqqa campaign alone, this small artillery battalion fired over 40,000 shells (including 34,033 155 mm), more than were used in the entire 2003 invasion of Iraq and only 20,000 fewer than all those fired by the US military in Operation Desert Storm.[298]\n\nIn March 2018, SDF press secretary in Deir ez-Zor Mehdi Kobani reportedly told Sputnik Turkiye that US forces were building a \"large military base\" in the oil-rich al-Omar region of Deir ez-Zor as new equipment had been reportedly arriving to US bases in Syria. The al-Omar oilfield is the largest oil deposit in Syria, and was captured by the SDF during their campaign against ISIL in October 2017.[299][300]\n\n2019 drawdown of US ground forces [ edit ]\n\nOn 19 December 2018, President Donald Trump announced that he ordered the pullout of all 2,000–2,500 US troops operating in Syria, though no clear timetable was given.[301] A day later, after failing to convince Trump to reconsider his decision to withdraw all American troops from Syria, Jim Mattis announced his resignation as Secretary of Defense.[302] On 3 January 2019, Trump described Syria as \"sand and death\" in defense of troop withdrawal.[303] US operations in al-Tanf would continue indefinitely.[304]\n\nOn 16 January 2019, a suicide bombing claimed by ISIL in the SDF-controlled town of Manbij killed four US personnel and injured three servicemen, making it the deadliest attack on Coalition forces in the country since the intervention.[305][306][307] The ISIL attack drew a second round of criticism of the US president's withdrawal order, with critics linking the attack with an emboldening of ISIL terror and insurgent tactics due to the announcement of a US pullout, despite the group's continued loss of territory in Syria.[308] President Trump offered condolences to the families of the slain American citizens on 17 January while he reaffirmed his policy of withdrawing troops.[309] Trump paid tribute to the fallen Americans during a trip to Dover Air Force Base in the US state of Delaware on 19 January, where their remains were received.[310]\n\nOn 21 January, an ISIL SVBIED targeted a US convoy accompanied by SDF troops on the Shadadi-Al-Hasakah road in Al-Hasakah province, killing five SDF personnel. Witnesses said the SVBIED rammed into an SDF vehicle by a checkpoint held by Kurdish forces a dozen kilometers outside Shadadi as the US convoy drove past. No Americans were harmed.[311]\n\nCNN reported on 24 January that additional US troops were moved to Syria to help provide security for the pullout of equipment and personnel as they are moved out via air and land routes. US Department of Defense officials said the additional security forces would move around Syria to different locations as needed and may move in and out of the country at times. Troop numbers would also fluctuate as American presence gradually declines. Defense officials declined to give specifics on numbers, locations, or timetables, citing security concerns.[312] Local sources reported to Anadolu Agency on 28 January that around 600 US troops had allegedly entered eastern Syria from western Iraq to help with the withdrawal process, arriving at discreet bases in Harab Isk and Sarrin villages set to be used as main evacuation centers during the withdrawal. The news agency added that the American-controlled airfields in Rmeilan and Tell Beydar would be used to airlift heavy weapons and equipment from the country; the Coalition itself did not confirm these reports.[313]\n\nBy the end of January 2019, according to two US officials, more than 10 percent of American equipment and supplies had been removed from Syria, with 3,000 additional personnel brought into the country to facilitate the draw-down of forces. By 9 February, hundreds of US airstrikes and ground support for the SDF continued as the Kurdish-led force began its final assault on the last ISIL holdouts trapped in a small cluster of hamlets in eastern Syria (including Al-Baghuz Fawqani and southern Al-Marashidah) no larger than a few square miles. US officials, including President Donald Trump, believed the SDF would be able to defeat the remaining diehard ISIL fighters \"in days\", bringing an end to ISIL's claim of a territorial caliphate.[314]\n\nOn 18 February, Commander-in-Chief of the SDF Mazlum Kobane expressed hopes the US would halt its total pullout. Kobane said there were discussions about perhaps French and British troops supporting them, but demanded 1,000–1,500 US troops stay in Syria to provide \"air cover, air support and a force on the ground\" to help the SDF in its ongoing fight against ISIL. CENTCOM commander Gen. Joseph Votel reiterated the US withdrawal was continuing.[315]\n\nWith the general withdrawal continuing, the White House announced late on 21 February that 200 residual US troops would remain in Syria as a \"peacekeeping force\". The peacekeeping deployment would be indefinite.[316] The next day it was revealed the actual number was 400 troops, not 200, as half would be based in Rojava and half at al-Tanf. Officials stated it was a part of an initiative to get NATO allies to commit to a multinational observer force that would establish a \"safe zone\" in Rojava to keep the Kurds and Turks from clashing, to prevent pro-Syrian government forces from attacking the Kurds, and to keep up pressure to prevent an ISIL resurgence. The US was not seeking a United Nations mandate for the deployment and did not envision asking NATO to sponsor the mission, an administration official said at the time, adding that the troops would not technically be \"peacekeepers,\" a term that carries restricted rules of engagement.[317]\n\nOn 7 March, Gen. Joseph Votel confirmed that US forces were in no rush to pullout by a specific date, instead saying the completion of the withdrawal was conditional on ISIL no longer posing a security threat to US forces and their allies.[318] By late March, the US continued to stretch the timetable for the pullout. On 29 March, US officials reportedly said the Pentagon's latest plans called for cutting its combat force in northeastern Syria roughly in half by early May 2019, or to about 1,000 troops, and would then pause pullout operations. The military would then reduce the number of forces every six months, depending on conditions on the ground, until it reaches the 400 troops previously approved by the president. Under this plan, the lowest troop numbers would not be reached until autumn 2020. The longer timetable would provide the US more time to negotiate and work out details over the planned multinational safe zone along Turkey's border. Officials cautioned that the timetable was open-ended and still subject to change, with factors ranging from allied troop contributions to new orders from the president himself.[319]\n\nIn early May, video emerged online of US forces firing upon an alleged Syrian government barge ferrying oil supplies in the Middle Euphrates River Valley. The video was posted on Facebook by the pro-SDF \"Deir Ezzor Media Center\".[320]\n\nWithdrawal from north Syria [ edit ]\n\nFollowing the collapse of the August–October 2019 Northern Syria Buffer Zone agreement and subsequent Turkish offensive against the SDF, US ground forces began deliberately withdrawing from many of their bases, outposts, and camps in north Syria around 6 October, including Manbij[321] and the Lafarge cement factory, upon \"precipitous\" orders from the Donald Trump administration.[322] Senior US military officials said that troops abandoned bases as far south as Tabqah and Raqqa and consolidated all personnel and essential equipment near Kobanî to await airlifts and convoys out of the country throughout coming weeks.[323] A US official at the time said the ≈1,000 US troops being withdrawn will mostly reposition in western Iraq but also possibly Kuwait and Jordan. From Iraq, US forces could conduct cross-border operations against ISIL in Syria, as they had done so in the past.[324]\n\nUS soldiers remove equipment and prepare to retrograde from their base at the Lafarge cement factory in north Syria, 15 October 2019\n\nDuring the withdrawal, which was described in news media as a \"scramble\", reports emerged showing that US and SDF troops had hastily stripped their camps and bases of sensitive materials but left fortifications in place, many of which became immediately occupied by Syrian government and Russian forces as they quickly moved into the region as part of a protection deal, established on 13 October, between the Assad government and Rojava. Video emerged online of Russian troops reportedly exploring an abandoned US outpost near Manbij.[323][325] On 16 October, two Operation Inherent Resolve F-15 jets bombed their section of the Lafarge cement factory base, located between Kobanî and Ayn Issa, \"to destroy an ammunition cache and reduce the facility's military usefulness\" as Turkish-backed militias advanced towards the area. \"The location had been the headquarters of the de facto Defeat-ISIS coalition in Syria,\" Inherent Resolve spokesman Col. Myles Caggins III said, adding that \"No US forces or equipment were ever in jeopardy and remain within separate, secure facilities.\" SDF personnel burned their part of the base before departing.[326] On the same day, President Trump commented on the developments by describing the Kurds as \"no angels\", and about Syria, he said: \"Syria may have some help with Russia, and that's fine. It's a lot of sand. They've got a lot of sand over there. So there's a lot of sand there that they can play with\".[327]\n\nOn 18 October, after a \"ceasefire\" between Turkish and Kurdish forces was declared a day prior, US Defense Secretary Mark Esper stated that the withdrawal was continuing and that the US would continue to communicate with both Turkey and the SDF. A senior defense official stated that US aircraft would continue to conduct intelligence missions over northeast Syria to monitor the situation there.[328] In late October, Esper said the US forces leaving Syria would head into western Iraq. But after Iraqi leaders said those troops can't stay there, Esper said they will be deployed in Iraq only temporarily before returning to the US[329] According to The New York Times, citing US Defense Department officials, by 30 October at least half of the original ≈1,000 US troops in Syria had withdrawn and was expected to be reduced to roughly 250 personnel, largely concentrated in the Deir ez-Zor region.[330]\n\nOn 31 October, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad called President Trump the \"best American president\", saying he was the most transparent foe, due to his audacity to openly discuss seizing Syrian oil.[331]\n\nOn 3 November 2019 US and coalition forces departed their strategic military base near the town of Sarrin. US forces removed all their equipment and were seen leaving the base in a convoy of tens of trucks. The base was one of the largest US bases in Syria, a logistics hub that assisted in the anti-ISIL intervention.[332] On 10 November, US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley stated that at least 500 to 600 US troops would remain in Syria and will not exceed 1,000 personnel. It was not clear if that estimate included the ≈200 troops at al-Tanf.[333]\n\nBy mid-November, Russian and Syrian government forces had quickly filled the power vacuum left behind by the US in much of northern Syria. The US had withdrawn from its logistics base in Kobanî by 14 November, with Russia announcing it would set up a new helicopter base in Qamishli the same day.[334] On 17 November, Russia's state-owned Zvezda channel aired footage of armed Russian sappers and Military Police seizing control of the Kobanî airbase days prior, with choppers landing on the US-made airstrip there and the Russian flag seen hoisted over the fortification, of which had been hastily stripped of essentials by coalition personnel, only leaving behind toiletries, sleeping facilities, some exercise equipment, and other small items.[335] While Syrian government troops gradually re-established its presence in the region, Russia and Turkey continued to occupy and conduct patrols throughout north east Syria as well, in accordance with the Sochi Agreement.\n\nBy 4 December, the US had completed its military pullback from northeastern Syria and had consolidated its troop presence in the country to a \"relatively static\" 600 personnel, according to Mark Esper.[336] The withdrawal from north Syria was partially carried out by the US Army 103rd Expeditionary Sustainment Command's Syria Logistics Cell (SLC), a key component of the Army's 1st Theater Sustainment Command, Special Operations Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve, and Combined Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve.[337]\n\n2019–20: Eastern Syria redeployment [ edit ]\n\nA US military convoy passes through Qamishli on 26 October 2019, amid the return of US forces to oil fields in northeast Syria\n\n4th Battalion, 118th Infantry Regiment (attached to 218th MEB) at a staging area in Syria, 10 November 2019\n\nBy 20 October 2019,[330] after backlash from the US Congress, the Trump administration had conducted a partial reversal of its 6 October order to pullout 1,000 troops from Syria, instead confirming a newly dedicated mission to guard oil and gas fields and related infrastructure in SDF-controlled eastern Syria from ISIL insurgent attacks. While US forces continued to reduce its presence in northern Syria by the hundreds to avoid Syrian-SDF and Turkish fighting, the US simultaneously shifted more resources south and east into the oil-rich Deir ez-Zor Governorate.[330] Defense Secretary Mark Esper confirmed on 25 October that the US would \"maintain a reduced presence in Syria and deny ISIS access to oil revenue\"[330] and, in support of the mission, mechanized and armored units would be deployed to eastern Syria to reinforce the American presence there.[329] Throughout late October-early November 2019, this contingent was reinforced with hundreds of new infantry troops joined by mechanized infantry Armored Brigade Combat Teams (ABCTs) in Bradley IFVs and—according to unnamed sources—potentially tanks, redeployed from Iraq and Kuwait, which was estimated to raise the number of US troops in eastern Syria to around 500 at the time. When coupled with the US garrison at al-Tanf, the contingency force's numbers rise to a flexible 800–900 personnel.[330] In Syria's Deir ez-Zor Governorate, which lies far to the North-East of al-Tanf, the United States has stated that it will increase its presence in SDF controlled territory along the Eastern bank of the Euphrates river and also establish military bases at al-Baghuz, al-Basira, al-Ezba, and the al-Omar oil field.[338]\n\nM2A2 Bradley IFVs of the 4th Battalion, 118th Infantry Regiment accompany a patrol in eastern Syria, 13 November 2019\n\nOn 30 October, 4th Battalion, 118th Infantry Regiment, a US combined arms battalion equipped with M2A2 Bradley IFVs deployed to the Deir ez-Zor region to help guard SDF-US controlled oil and gas fields. The battalion is part of the US Army National Guard's 30th ABCT which had begun arriving in Kuwait the week prior to relieve the regular Army 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division in support of Operation Spartan Shield, the US's theater-level contingency force for the Middle East.[339] By 31 October, US forces in M-ATV convoys were seen conducting dedicated patrols of oil and gas-related facilities throughout Syria's al-Hasakah and Deir ez-Zor Governorates, usually accompanied by SDF personnel. The US's deployment of heavy armored vehicles to Syria for the first time in the intervention—as opposed to the lighter armored RG-33s, M-ATVs, Strykers, Armored Ground Mobility Systems,[citation needed] and NSTVs (Non-Standard Tactical Vehicles) US special operations units and regular ground forces have used prior—introduced additional firepower and force protection capabilities for ground forces.[339] Nevertheless, the Bradley IFVs were pulled out of Syria after less than two months of deployment due to unspecified reasons.[340]\n\nOn 3 November, OIR officials confirmed that multiple artillery rounds landed about one kilometer from a road with a US convoy; OIR, without offering additional details, stated no personnel were injured and the patrol was not hit. The Russian Defense Ministry were the first to report the incident, adding that the incident was near Tell Tamer and that it was elements of Turkish-backed rebels that fired the artillery.[341] On 4 November, Rudaw briefly interviewed a US special operations soldier during a patrol at an oilfield near Rmelan, who stated that US forces are \"working with the SDF and they're letting us know the situation up here as they see it.\" According to North Press Agency, the US patrol had begun in Rmelan and spanned the towns of al-Jawadiyah, al-Malikiyah, and Ain-Diwar.[342] On 15 December, a large US logistical convoy en route to Deir ez-Zor was reportedly seen crossing Semalka into al-Hasakah province from Iraq.[343]\n\nBy mid-January 2020, tensions between Russian and US forces in northeast Syria had reportedly grown as US troops had increasingly begun blocking Russian convoys from accessing certain major roads between towns. Both Russia and the US operate military outposts throughout the region as a part of their respective missions.[344] On 25 August, a Russian military vehicle rammed a US armored car near al-Malikiyah, northeastern Syria, in which four US soldiers had suffered mild concussions. Russian defense minister Sergey Shoygu said that \"the US armed forces soldiers tried to block the Russian patrol\"; meanwhile, a US defense official said that Russian forces went to a \"security zone\" that they should not enter.[345]\n\nOn 30 July 2020, the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria signed an agreement with an American oil company, Delta Crescent Energy LLC, to develop oil fields in the region.[346] The Syrian authorities condemned the agreement, and mentioned that: \"This agreement is null and void and has no legal basis.\"[347] Seizing oil without local government permission would be a war crime of pillage.[348]\n\nOn 17 August, US forces killed at least one Syrian soldier and wounded two others, after a fire exchange near a checkpoint in the village of Tal Dahab, near Qamishli, northeastern Syria.[349]\n\nOn 19 September, the US deployed additional troops, equipment and armored vehicles to north-eastern Syria after tensions with Russia escalated in the region. According to officials, the moves were meant \"to help ensure the safety and security of coalition forces.\"[350] US Central Command mentioned that the United States had deployed Sentinel radars and Bradley vehicles to augment forces in the \"Eastern Syria Security Area\" (ESSA).[351] The reinforcements were considered a response to a 26 August incident where a Russian armored vehicle collided with a coalition M-ATV, injuring four US soldiers.[352]\n\nIt was reported on 30 November 2020 that an airstrike near the Iraq–Syria border killed an unidentified Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps commander and three other men traveling with him from Iraq and into Syria. The vehicle was struck after it entered Syrian territory. Iraqi security and local militia officials said the commander's vehicle had weapons in it and that pro-Iran paramilitary groups helped retrieve the bodies. Sources did not identify the commander nor elaborate on the exact time of the incident. It was not immediately known who conducted the strike, and Reuters could not independently verify the reports.[353]\n\n2021–present: Continued Iranian—US proxy conflict [ edit ]\n\nUS 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry Regiment troops conduct area reconnaissance in Syria, 18 February 2021\n\nOn 10 February 2021, Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby told reporters that US troops were not committed to protecting Syrian oil fields except \"for where appropriate under certain existing authorizations to protect civilians.\" He added that \"DOD [Department of Defense] personnel or contractors are not authorized to provide assistance to any other private company, including its employees or agents, seeking to develop oil resources in northeastern Syria.\"[49] However, there were reports from local sources in northeastern Syria that US forces had transported oil and wheat smuggled from Syria to Iraq.[354]\n\nOn 28 June 2021, President Biden directed airstrikes against Iran-backed militia groups close to the Syria-Iraq border.[355] F-15E and F-16 aircraft were used to launch the attack in what the U.S. described as a retaliatory attack against U.S. facilities and personnel in Iraq by militia groups.[356][357] Two operational and weapons storage facilities were targeted in Syria, the U.S. military revealed in a statement.[358] Despite the U.S. not disclosing the information regarding the casualties in the attack, the SOHR stated that at least nine Iran-backed Iraqi militia fighters died, leaving many others injured.[359] Iraqi militia groups aligned with Iran in a statement named four members of the Kataib Sayyed al-Shuhada faction they said were killed in the attack on the Syria-Iraq border. Hours later, U.S. forces in Syria came under fire, following the U.S. strikes on the Syria-Iraqi border.[360] Pro-Iranian militias fired rockets at the American base at Al-Omar Oilfield in Syria in response to U.S. airstrikes.[361] The U.S. coalition responded by firing heavy artillery on Iranian-backed Militias Positions around Al-Mayadin.[362][363] There were no injuries sustained during the attack, the spokesman for Operation Inherent Resolve, Col. Wayne Marotto disclosed.[364][365]\n\nOn 10 July 2021, a mortar shell landed near MSS Conoco, with no injuries reported. It was reportedly the fourth attack on or near U.S. troops or diplomats within a week, reportedly including one in which two service members were injured. No group claimed responsibility, but U.S. forces suspected Iran-backed proxy militias of carrying out such attacks.[366]\n\nOn 20 October 2021, troops at the al-Tanf garrison were attacked by bomb-laden drones in what Pentagon spokesman John Kirby called a \"complex, coordinated and deliberate attack\". U.S. officials reportedly blamed Iran and its proxy forces for the attack, but publicly declined to specify details of the attack and whether the U.S. was considering retaliation. There were no reports of deaths or injuries. Attacks by small drones carrying munitions have posed a consistent threat to U.S. forces in eastern Syria since at least March 2020, with U.S. forces suspecting ISIL or Iran-backed elements of conducting the attacks, as U.S.-Iranian tensions in the region have persisted.[367]\n\nOn 24 August 2022, Joe Biden ordered airstrikes on claimed IRGC and Russian-backed proxy groups in Syria near Deir ez-Zor.[368][369][370] The airstrikes were in retaliation on an attack on the Al-Tanf garrison.[371] The airstrikes were also considered a massive setback in negotiations in order to revive the JCPOA. Airstrikes were also reported on 25 August. Iran strongly condemned the strikes and denied any links with the targets.[372][373] The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights claimed that Liwa Fatemiyoun and the Syrian Army were targeted in the airstrikes.[374]\n\nOn 23 March 2023, at 1:38 p.m. local time (UTC+03:00), a kamikaze drone allegedly of Iranian origin struck a coalition base at Abu Hajar Airport near Rmelan, al-Hasakah Governorate in northeastern Syria,[375] killing one United States contractor and injuring five servicemen and second contractor.[376][377][378] The New York Times reported, US officials said the main air defense system at the base was \"not fully operational\" at the time of Thursday's Drone Strike.[379] In retaliation, U.S. President Joe Biden authorized a response with an airstrike on IRGC-linked targets,[380] including a weapons warehouse in the Harabish neighborhood in Deir ez-Zor, and military posts in the al-Mayadin and Abu Kamal countryside,[381] killing 14 people including nine Syrians, according to SOHR.[382][383][384]\n\nOn 24 March 2023, 10 rockets were launched at the Green Village near al-Omar oil field which injured another American serviceman.[378] By afternoon, another rocket attack targeted US forces near the oil and gas fields of Conoco, east of Deir ez-Zor.[385] On 30 March, the Pentagon revealed that twelve American were wounded in total with six U.S. troops in Syria suffering traumatic brain injuries due to the two attacks by Iran-backed militias.[386] A little-known militant group known as Liwa Al-Ghaliboun (The Brigade of Those who Prevail)[387] claimed responsibility for the initial drone attack, although some observers believe the group to simply be a front group for a larger Iranian-backed group or the IRGC.\n\nOn 18 October 2023, American military bases in Iraq, Iraqi Kurdistan and eastern Syria were attacked by three drones. Pentagon officials insisted that there are few casualties.[388][389][390][391] On 26 October, United States DoD said it conducted airstrikes on two facilities in eastern Syria linked to IRGC-backed militias in retaliation for the attacks.[392]\n\nTurkish involvement [ edit ]\n\nUS and Turkish soldiers conduct joint patrols, Manbij outskirts, 1 November 2018\n\nTurkey, a NATO member, has been involved in the Syrian civil war since the beginning of hostilities. Turkey has trained and armed some members of the Free Syrian Army and al-Qaeda in Syria,[393][394] and has been involved in certain spillover incidents. On 2 October 2014, the Turkish Parliament authorized direct military action in both Iraq and Syria including using military force in Syria and Iraq as well as allowing coalition members to use bases in Turkey.[395] Turkey has also stationed troops and tanks on its southern border near the Syrian border city of Kobanî.[396] The Turkish government demanded several things to go along with them intervening against ISIL, including a buffer zone in Northern Syria, a no-fly zone over certain parts of northern Syria, ground troops from other countries, and the training of moderate opposition forces to fight both ISIL and al-Assad.[397][398]\n\nIn October 2014, the Turkish Parliament authorized direct military action in both Iraq and Syria, including using military force, as well as allowing Combined Joint Task Force – Operation Inherent Resolve members to use bases in Turkey.[395][396][397][398] The same month, US Vice President Joe Biden accused Turkey of funding al-Nusra and al Qaeda,[399] after which Turkish President Recep Erdoğan demanded an apology, adding that if no apology was made, Biden would become \"history to me.\"[400] Biden subsequently apologized.[401]\n\nOn 22 February 2015, the Turkish Army mounted an operation across the border to evacuate its soldiers from the Tomb of Suleyman Shah and relocate the tomb. The Turkish convoy of 572 troops in 39 tanks and 57 armoured vehicles transited through Kurdish-held city of Kobanî en route to the tomb. One Turkish soldier was killed in what government of Turkey described as an accident. The success of the operation was announced 22 February by Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu.[402]\n\nRising anti-American sentiment in Turkey has occurred since the start of the Turkish invasion of northern Syria in January 2018 aimed at ousting Syrian Kurdish forces from the enclave of Afrin. A poll conducted in Turkey during the operation revealed that 90 percent of respondents believed that the United States is \"behind\" the Kurdish PKK and YPG.[403] After the start of the Turkish invasion, US Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis stated that \"Turkey is a NATO ally. It's the only NATO country with an active insurgency inside its borders. And Turkey has legitimate security concerns.\"[404] Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Bekir Bozdag urged the United States to halt its support for Kurdish YPG fighters, saying: \"Those who support the terrorist organization will become a target in this battle.\"[405]\n\nOn 30 April 2023, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan announced that the Turkish National Intelligence Organization had allegedly tracked down and killed ISIS leader Abu al-Hussein al-Husseini al-Qurashi on 29 April.[406] Turkish media reported that the operation occurred at Jindires, in which Abu al-Hussein detonated his suicide vest to avoid being captured.[407] However, the United States could not verify claims by Turkey that its forces killed Abu al-Hussein al-Husseini al-Qurashi.[408]\n\nIn August ISIS said Quraishi was killed during clashes with the Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), whom it accused to be agents of Turkish intelligence.[citation needed] The United States believes the HTS is behind the killing despite the latter's denials.[409]\n\nNorthern Syria Buffer Zone [ edit ]\n\nUS and Turkish soldiers rendezvous in the Northern Syria Buffer Zone, 4 October 2019.\n\nOn 15 January 2019, the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he agreed with setting up a 35 km (22 mi) \"safe zone\" in northern Syria, after engaging with US President Donald Trump a few days prior.[410]\n\nOn 7 August 2019, after months of negotiations, Turkey and the US reached a deal to create a 115 km (71 mi) buffer zone in northern Syria along the Syria–Turkey border between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Separate from Turkey's own occupation zone in northern Syria, the deal was reached partly to prevent a potential future Turkish ground incursion into Rojava against US-backed Kurdish forces. Under the framework of the deal, the US and Turkey conducted joint troop patrols, and Turkish reconnaissance aircraft would be allowed to monitor the zone. Kurdish YPG and YPJ forces along the Turkish border dismantled their border fortifications, withdrew to a \"security belt\" alongside regular SDF forces, and removed all heavy weapons from the area. In turn, Turkey was not to conduct airstrikes or establish military observation posts in northern Syria, and was not to \"occupy\" the region, as administrative and civil rule was to be relegated to SDF military councils and the Kurdish Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria. According to the SDF, the majority of the zone was not to include any cities or towns.[411]\n\nThe buffer zone agreement was proven to be short-lived and collapsed on 7 October, after US President Donald Trump gave his approval for a Turkish ground offensive into Rojava, and ordered the withdrawal of US troops from northern Syria. The agreement was rendered fully obsolete on 9 October, when Turkey launched a ground incursion into Rojava.[412] In response to the offensive, US Senator Lindsey Graham warned that he would \"introduce bipartisan sanctions against Turkey if they invade Syria.\" He said he would also \"call for their suspension from NATO if they attack Kurdish forces who assisted the US in the destruction of the ISIS Caliphate.\"[413]\n\nReports of civilian casualties and war crimes [ edit ]\n\nA coalition airstrike on ISIL positions in Kobanî.\n\nOn 29 September 2014, several groups including the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), the Aleppo Media Center, and the Local Coordination Committees reported that US strikes hit a grain silo in the ISIL-controlled town of Manbij in northern Syria, killing two civilians.[414]\n\nThe SOHR reported ten airstrikes, also targeting various parts of the province of Idlib, killed at least one child and six other civilians. The group said at least 19 civilians had been killed in coalition airstrikes at that time.[415] The Pentagon reported it had no evidence of any civilian casualties from airstrikes targeting militants in Syria.[416] The United States has also acknowledged that its rules to avoid civilian casualties are looser in Syria than those for drone strikes elsewhere.[417]\n\nThe SOHR and other activist groups reported that seven civilians were killed when an air strike hit a gas distribution facility near the town of al-Khasham is the eastern Deir al-Zor province on 17 October 2014 and three civilians were killed in an air strike on 16 October 2014 in the north east province of al-Hassakah. According to their reports, most of the civilians killed were fuel tanker drivers.[418]\n\nAccording to Reuters, 50 civilians were killed in Syria by US-led airstrikes, from the start of the campaign in late September 2014 to mid-November.[419] On 28 December 2014, a US airstrike in the northern Syrian town of Al-Bab killed more than 50 civilians.[420]\n\nOn 21 May 2015, the United States admitted it \"probably\" killed two children in bombings near Harem on 4 and 5 November 2014. These are the first such admissions of the campaign, and followed a military investigation. A similar investigation regarding an event in Syria is underway, and two regarding events in Iraq.[421] Two adult civilians were also minorly injured in the Harem strikes. The deaths and injuries are attributed by the military investigation to unintentional secondary explosions, after the bombers hit their intended targets, linked to the Khorasan.[422] On 19 July 2016 a coalition led airstrike on the ISIL controlled villages of Tokhar and Hoshariyeh reportedly killed at least 56 civilians, including 11 children.[423] On 3 August 2016, dozens of civilians were killed after an airstrike in al-Qa'im, some sources claiming that 30 were killed.[424]\n\nAirwars, which \"maintains an extensive database of all known allegations in which civilians and friendly forces have been reported killed by the Coalition since August 2014\", reports between 503 and 700 civilians were killed by Coalition airstrikes in Syria as of April 2016.[425]\n\nAt least 33 people were killed in a US-led coalition airstrike on a school near Raqqa in March 2017.[426] On 16 March 2017, a US airstrike in rebel-held Aleppo killed at least 46 people and wounded more than 100 after warplanes hit a mosque.[427]\n\nA destroyed neighborhood in Raqqa in August 2017\n\nAccording to a report by Amnesty International, the US-led Coalition has provided falsified data to conceal the actual number of civilian deaths resulting from their bombing campaigns and is \"deeply in denial\" about civilian casualties in Raqqa. After an investigation by Amnesty International in June 2018, the US-led Coalition confirmed that \"coalition air strikes killed 70 civilians, mostly women and children—including 39 members of a single family.\"[428]\n\nAccording to Airwars,[429] the strikes of US-led coalition killed as many as 6,000 civilians in Syria and Iraq in 2017.[430]\n\nOn 2 May 2018, Britain's Ministry of Defense admitted for the first time that a civilian was \"unintentionally\" killed in an anti-ISIL drone strike on 26 March 2018. According to the MoD, the civilian was on a motorbike and entered the target area at the last minute. Defense Secretary Gavin Williamson said the incident was \"deeply regrettable\".[431][432]\n\nOn 18 March 2019, during the Battle of Baghuz Fawqani, a US special operations-led airstrike killed up to 80 people, including 64 civilians, almost exclusively women and children, and 18 ISIL militants, according to The New York Times. The site of the strike was bulldozed and the incident was covered up by the US military until a New York Times report exposed the cover-up in November 2021.[433] A US military investigation in May 2022 concluded that the airstrike killed 52 ISIL fighters and 4 civilians and did not violate the laws of war.[434]\n\nOn 25 April 2019 a joint investigation by Amnesty International and Airwars of over 200 strike sites reported that anti-ISIL Coalition bombing during the 2017 Battle of Raqqa had killed 1,600 civilians alone. CJTF-OIR reported the month prior that its 4-year operations over both Iraq and Syria amounted to 1,257 civilian casualties overall. \"Coalition forces razed Raqqa...Amnesty International and Airwars call upon the Coalition forces to end their denial about the shocking scale of civilian deaths and destruction caused by their offensive in Raqqa,\" the investigators said in a joint statement. The Coalition responded that they \"continue to employ thorough and deliberate targeting and strike processes to minimize the impact of our operations on civilian populations and infrastructure.\"[435]\n\nBy August 2023, Airwars estimated 8,198–13,258 civilian deaths in Iraq and Syria due to Coalition airstrikes, including 1,725–2,367 children, 1,120-1,460 women, and 3,722 named victims. The Coalition's own estimate of civilian deaths was 1,417. Coalition airstrikes also wounded between 5,883 and 9,111 civilians.[436]\n\nResults [ edit ]\n\nAn ISIL command and control center before and after an F-22 airstrike on 23 September 2014\n\nThe US-led air campaign inflicted heavy losses on the Islamic State and, alongside special forces operations, artillery strikes, and material and intelligence support to the SDF, catalyzed the loss of the bulk of ISIL's Syrian territory. By late 2015, coalition planes were dropping or launching an average of 67 bombs or missiles a day.[437]\n\nAccording to CJTF-OIR, by May 2016, ISIL had lost 25 percent of the territory it possessed in Syria since the campaign began, mostly due to advances by YPG/SDF forces with heavy Coalition air support.[438] By the end of 2016 the US-led air campaign against ISIL in both Iraq and Syria was estimated by the Pentagon to have struck 32,000 targets (including 164 tanks, 400 Humvees, and 2,638 pieces of oil infrastructure) and killed 50,000 militants, with approximately 1/3 of the losses taking place in Syria.[40][439]\n\nBy August 2017, CJTF-OIR had flown 168,000 sorties in both Syria and Iraq (mostly against ISIL).[40] By December 2017, the Pentagon increased the estimate to 80,000 ISIL fighters killed by coalition airstrikes between Iraq and Syria.[440] By the end of 2018, the SDF, assisted by the coalition, had liberated over 20,000 square kilometers of territory, and three million Syrian civilians from the Islamic State.[441]\n\nBy 23 March 2019, the day of ISIL's territorial collapse in Syria, CJTF-OIR and partner forces had liberated nearly 110,000 square kilometres (42,000 sq mi) from the Islamic State; as a result, 7.7 million people no longer lived under ISIL's \"caliphate\".[442]\n\nThe United Nations estimated in August 2020 that over 10,000 ISIL insurgents remained in Syria and Iraq.[443]\n\nReactions [ edit ]\n\nDomestic US approval [ edit ]\n\nThe intervention was initially conducted with strong domestic US support; according to Gallup polling in 2014, 61% of Americans supported intervention against ISIL in both Iraq and Syria, while 30% were opposed, and 9% undecided.[444] A larger CCGA poll taken in 2016 showed that 72% of Americans supported \"conducting airstrikes against violent Islamic extremist groups in Syria\", while 58% also supported \"sending special operations forces into Syria to fight violent Islamic extremist groups.\" Additionally, a slim majority (52%) supported \"enforcing a no-fly zone over parts of Syria, including bombing Syrian air defenses.\" However, only 26% supported \"sending arms and other supplies to anti-government rebel groups in Syria.\"[445]\n\nA CNN poll conducted between 17 and 20 October 2019 (during a withdrawal of US troops from northern Syria amid a Turkish offensive there) showed that 75% of Americans were generally concerned about the situation in Syria, with 43% saying they were \"very concerned\". 51% thought the US had a responsibility to remain involved in the Syrian conflict (seven months after ISIL's final Syrian settlement had fallen), while 43% did not.[446]\n\nSyrian reactions [ edit ]\n\nInternational reactions [ edit ]\n\nIn a Pew poll taken in 2015, a median of 62% of people across the nations polled said they support American military efforts against the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria, while a median of 24% were opposed. Among those in support were 78% of Lebanese, 77% of Jordanians, 48% of Turks, 53% of Palestinians, and 84% of Israelis, as well as 81% of French, 66% of British, and 62% of Germans.[454]\n\nDmitry Peskov, spokesman for the Russian President Vladimir Putin, described the US air strikes on the Shayrat airbase as \"an act of aggression against a sovereign state delivered in violation of international law under a far-fetched pretext.... a serious blow to Russian-US relations, which are already in a poor state\". [ 468 ]\n\nForeign Minister Sergei Lavrov referred to the Sharyat attack as \"an act of aggression under a completely invented pretext\". He compared events in April 2017 to \"the situation of 2003, when the USA, the UK and several of their allies invaded Iraq without the UN Security Council's approval—a grave violation of international law—but at that point they at least tried to show some material evidence.\" [ 468 ]\n\nSee also [ edit ]",

        "description": "The days-long conflict has been among Syria's deadliest in a decade. Nearly 1,000 civilians have been killed, including women and children, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.\n\nSyria's Defense Ministry announced the end of military operations against loyalists of ousted President Bashar Assad along the Mediterranean coast on Monday, in what has been among the bloodiest conflicts in a decade.\n\nThe violence erupted after Assad loyalists ambushed a Syrian security patrol last week, leading to intense clashes and a series of revenge killings targeting Assad's Alawite sect.\n\nThe clashes killed 973 civilians, including women and children, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) on Monday. Those targeted included civilians who were not members of the Alawite sect.\n\nWhat else do we know about the clashes?\n\nSyria's new authorities launched an investigation into the conflict Image: Karam al-Masri/REUTERS\n\nDefense Ministry spokesperson Hassan Abdel-Ghani said that public institutions were now able to resume work and offer services.\n\n\"We were able to absorb the attacks from the remnants of the former regime and its officers. We shattered their element of surprise and managed to push them away from vital centers, securing most of the main roads,\" Abdel-Ghani said, in statements carried by the state news agency SANA.\n\nThe SOHR reported on Monday that a total of 39 \"massacres\" were reported since the violence erupted last week in Latakia, once the stronghold of the Assad family. It then spread to Tartus, Hama and Homs. The Mediterranean coast is seen as the Alawite heartland in Syria.\n\nWidespread revenge operations against the Alawites were reported amid the clashes, with the SOHR describing them as \"ethnic cleansing.\" The killings have been accompanied by the burning of homes and forced displacement.\n\nTensions have been escalating since Assad's ouster last December, with sectarian attacks continuing despite promises from Syria's interim rulers of the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) to preserve inclusivity and protect minorities.\n\nAssad loyalist gunmen overwhelmed government security forces during their ambush and briefly seized the hometown of the ousted president, Qardaha. Damascus struggled to send reinforcements.\n\nWho are the Alawites?\n\nThe Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shia Islam, was a key support base for Assad's government in the Sunni-majority country.\n\nThe fighting has killed hundreds of security forces as well as pro-Assad fighters in Latakia, once the stronghold of the Assad family Image: Karam al-Masri/REUTERS\n\nMany of Assad's opponents viewed his rule as granting privileges to the Alawite community.\n\nDuring the civil war, militant groups emerged across Syria, often treating Alawites as allies of Assad and his backers, Russia and Iran.\n\nWhat have the international reactions been?\n\nBoth the Kremlin and Tehran condemned on Monday the violence in Syria and called for it to end as soon as possible.\n\nIran's Foreign Ministry also denied any involvement in the violence. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told the French AFP news agency last Friday that Tehran has remained \"an observer” since Assad's overthrow.\n\nChina's Foreign Ministry called for an immediate halt to the fighting. Meanwhile the French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot also condemned the violence, stating that \"those responsible must be punished.”\n\nSyria's interim government has promised a transition to a political system that includes the country's diverse religious and ethnic groups through fair elections. Interim President Ahmad Al-Sharaa, a former leader of the Sunni HTS, has made assurances of inclusivity, but many remain doubtful about whether true representation will be achieved.\n\nMiddle East expert on Syria clashes To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nEdited by: Rana Taha",

        "description": "JABLEH, Syria (AP) — Syria’s interim government signed a deal Monday with the Kurdish-led authority that controls the country’s northeast, including a ceasefire and the merging of the main U.S.-backed force there into the Syrian army.\n\nThe deal is a major breakthrough that would bring most of Syria under the control of the government, which is led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham that led the ouster of President Bashar Assad in December.\n\nThe deal was signed by interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa and Mazloum Abdi, the commander of the U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces.\n\nThe deal to be implemented by the end of the year would bring all border crossings with Iraq and Turkey, airports and oil fields in the northeast under the central government’s control. Prisons where about 9,000 suspected members of the Islamic State group are also expected to come under government control.\n\nSyria’s Kurds will gain their “constitutional rights” including using and teaching their language, which were banned for decades under Assad. Hundreds of thousands of Kurds, who were displaced during Syria’s nearly 14-year civil war, will return to their homes. Thousands of Kurds living in Syria who have been deprived of nationality for decades under Assad will be given the right of citizenship, according to the agreement.\n\nThe deal also says all Syrians will be part of the political process, no matter their religion or ethnicity.\n\nSyria’s new rulers are struggling to exert their authority across the country and reach political settlements with other minority communities, notably the Druze in southern Syria.\n\nEarlier on Monday, Syria’s government announced the end of the military operation against insurgents loyal to Assad and his family in the worst fighting since the end of the civil war.\n\nThe Defense Ministry’s announcement came after a surprise attack by gunmen from the Alawite community on a police patrol near the port city of Latakia on Thursday spiraled into widespread clashes across Syria’s coastal region. The Assad family are Alawites.\n\n“To the remaining remnants of the defeated regime and its fleeing officers, our message is clear and explicit,” said Defense Ministry spokesperson Col. Hassan Abdel-Ghani. “If you return, we will also return, and you will find before you men who do not know how to retreat and who will not have mercy on those whose hands are stained with the blood of the innocent.”\n\nAbdel-Ghani said security forces will continue searching for sleeper cells and remnants of the insurgency of former government loyalists.\n\nThough the government’s counter-offensive was able to largely contain the insurgency, footage surfaced of what appeared to be retaliatory attacks targeting the broader minority Alawite community, an offshoot of Shia Islam whose adherents live mainly in the western coastal region.\n\nSajid Allah Al-Deek, a security official in the coastal region, told The Associated Press that security forces were deployed in the area from the Latakia governorate to Jableh and that the coastal highway is functioning again after being closed because of the fighting.\n\n“The civilians have begun returning to their homes,” Al-Deek said, adding that authorities have started detaining those blamed for acts of violence.\n\nImad Baytar said his father, who worked for a taxi company, had gone from Jableh to Damascus and on his way back over the weekend “he was killed in the checkpoint.” Baytar blamed Assad supporters for the killing.\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, said 1,130 people were killed in the clashes, including 830 civilians. The AP could not independently verify these numbers.\n\nAl-Sharaa said the retaliatory attacks against Alawite civilians and mistreatment of prisoners were isolated incidents, and vowed to crack down on the perpetrators as he formed a committee to investigate.\n\nStill, the events alarmed Western governments, who have been urged to lift economic sanctions on Syria.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio in a statement Sunday urged Syrian authorities to “hold the perpetrators of these massacres” accountable. Rubio said the U.S. “stands with Syria’s religious and ethnic minorities, including its Christian, Druze, Alawite, and Kurdish communities.”\n\n___\n\nMroue and Chehayeb reported from Beirut.",

        "description": "Defence Ministry spokesman says security threats had been neutralised in al-Assad strongholds of Latakia and Tartous.\n\nSyria’s government has ended a security operation in the country’s western coastal region, home to loyalists of former leader Bashar al-Assad, the Ministry of Defence in Damascus reported.\n\nSpokesperson Hassan Abdul Ghani made the announcement on Monday, saying in a statement on X that security threats had been neutralised in Latakia and Tartous provinces. More than 1,000 people, including many civilians, are reported to have been killed in days of deadly violence that prompted international concern.\n\n“Having achieved [the neutralisation of the security threats] we announce the end of the military operation,” Ghani said. “We were able … to absorb the attacks of the remnants of the toppled regime and its officers” and push them from “vital” locations.\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Monday that nearly 1,500 people had been killed in the violence since Thursday.\n\nThe majority, the war monitor reported, were civilians killed by security forces and allied groups in the heartland of the Alawite minority, to which deposed President Bashar al-Assad belongs. Al Jazeera has not verified the report.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSyria’s interim leader President Ahmed al-Sharaa of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) pledged on Sunday to hunt down the perpetrators of the violent clashes and said he would hold to account anyone who overstepped the new rulers’ authority.\n\nAl-Sharaa’s office also said it was forming an independent committee to investigate the clashes and killings carried out by both sides.\n\nAbdul Ghani added on Monday that the security forces would cooperate with the investigation committee, offering full access to uncover the circumstances of the events, verify the facts and ensure justice for the wronged.\n\n“We were able to absorb the attacks from the remnants of the former regime and its officers. We shattered their element of surprise and managed to push them away from vital centres, securing most of the main roads,” he said.\n\nRising instability\n\n“We are paving the way for life to return to normal and for the consolidation of security and stability,” Abdul Ghani said, adding that plans were in place to continue combating the remnants of the former government and eliminate any future threats.\n\nHowever, following relative calm in the weeks following al-Assad’s fall in December, instability and violence are starting to grow in Syria.\n\nSecurity forces reported that they had repelled an attack on a security checkpoint in the capital, Damascus, overnight.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Resul Serdar, reporting from the capital, said two attackers, who were trying to target a government building, were arrested. Other gunmen managed to escape, the security forces told him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“It’s still not clear if they are also part of the remnants of the old regime, or a separate group who wanted to attack,” Serdar said.\n\n“It has been an intense week here in the heart of Damascus.”\n\nThe fighting on the Mediterranean coast began last week when pro-Assad forces coordinated deadly attacks on the new government’s security forces.\n\nThe ambush spiralled into revenge killings as thousands of armed supporters of Syria’s new leadership flocked to coastal areas.\n\nEstimates suggest about 1,000 civilians were killed amid indiscriminate attacks, including reports of brutal murders.\n\nThe government then sent reinforcements to Latakia and Tartous in order to regain control.\n\n‘100 percent misleading’\n\nIran, a long-term al-Assad ally, denied on Monday any involvement in the violence.\n\nMedia reports including from the Saudi-owned Al Arabiya TV channel have suggested that Iran and allied groups in the region were behind the violence.\n\nAl-Sharaa had blamed the violence on “attempts by the remnants of the toppled regime and foreign parties behind them to create renewed sedition and pull our country into civil war”.\n\nRegional media had then followed up by pointing the finger at Tehran.\n\nHowever, a spokesman for Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs rejected the accusation and condemned attacks on minorities in Syria.\n\n“This accusation is completely ridiculous and rejected, and we think that pointing the finger of accusation at Iran and Iran’s friends is wrongly addressed, a deviant trend, and a hundred percent misleading,” Esmaeil Baghaei said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“There is no justification for the attacks on parts of the Alawite, Christian, Druze and other minorities, which have truly wounded the emotions and conscience of both the countries of the region and internationally,” he added.\n\nTehran helped to prop up al-Assad during the country’s long civil war and provided him with military advisers.\n\nForeign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Friday that Tehran has remained “an observer” of the situation in Syria since the takeover by HTS.\n\n“We have no relationship with the current Syrian government, and we are not in a hurry in this regard,” he said.",

After a 2020 cease-fire ended the country’s six-year civil war between rival political factions, a UN-supported process led to the formation of a Government of National Unity (GNU). Due to rival factions’ unwillingness to agree on rules overseeing national elections scheduled for December 2021, the vote was postponed indefinitely. Widespread frustration from actors on both sides of the political divide has put pressure on the GNU to hold the long-overdue elections without delay, but little progress has been made. Reflecting the relatively low levels of violence since 2020, the humanitarian situation has eased in recent years. In 2023, approximately three hundred thousand people needed humanitarian assistance in Libya, down from 1.3 million [PDF] in 2016. But compounding threats have posed new challenges for the country, including the worsening effects of a precarious and oil-dependent economy, arms proliferation, climate change, and complex migration crises.\n\nBackground\n\nLibya has struggled [PDF] to rebuild state institutions since the ouster and subsequent death of former leader Muammar al-Qaddafi in October 2011. Libya’s transitional government ceded authority to the newly elected [PDF] General National Congress (GNC) in July 2012. The GNC faced numerous challenges over the next two years, including the September 2012 attack by Islamist militants on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi and the spread of the Islamic State and other armed groups throughout the country.\n\nIn May 2014, General Khalifa Haftar launched Operation Dignity, a campaign conducted by the Libyan National Army (LNA) to attack Islamist militant groups across eastern Libya, including in Benghazi. To counter this movement, Islamist militants and armed groups—including Ansar al-Sharia—formed a coalition called Libya Dawn. Eventually, fighting broke out at Tripoli’s international airport between the Libya Dawn coalition, which controlled Tripoli and much of western Libya, and the Dignity coalition, which controlled parts of Cyrenaica and Benghazi in eastern Libya, escalating the conflict into a full-fledged civil war.\n\nThe battle for control over Libya crosses tribal, regional, political, and religious lines. Each coalition has created governing institutions and named military chiefs—and each has faced internal fragmentation and division. To find a resolution to the conflict and establish a unity government, then-UN Special Envoy to Libya Bernardino Leon, followed by Martin Kobler, facilitated a series of talks between the Tobruk-based House of Representatives (HoR)—based in Libya’s east and a key supporter of Haftar—and the Tripoli-based GNC. The talks resulted in the creation of the Libyan Political Agreement [PDF] and the UN-supported Government of National Accord (GNA) in December 2015. However, the GNA faced obstacles to creating a stable, unified government in Libya.\n\nTaking advantage of the widespread political instability, armed Islamist groups, including Ansar al-Sharia—the terrorist group allegedly responsible for the attack on the U.S. consulate in 2012—and the Islamic State, have used the country as a hub to coordinate broader regional violence, further complicating efforts to create a unity government. After seizing territory [PDF] in Benghazi, Derna, and Ajdabiya, the Islamic State’s power in Libya peaked in 2016 when it captured the coastal city of Sirte—formerly the group’s most significant stronghold outside of Syria and Iraq. While in control, its members committed numerous human rights abuses for which they now face trial in Libya. In July 2018, Haftar announced that the LNA had recaptured the city of Derna, the last outpost of the Islamic State militants in eastern Libya. However, the group continues to operate throughout the country.\n\nThough the Islamic State was largely defeated in Libya in 2016, the GNA and HoR remained divided on a path to unification. In August 2018, violence in Tripoli ended the relative calm maintained for over a year. However, the UN quickly brokered a September 2018 cease-fire between the involved militias.\n\nForeign states have also taken an interest in Libya, with Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), France, and Russia backing Haftar’s LNA and Turkey, Qatar, and Italy supporting the UN-backed GNA. Egypt and the UAE have been particularly involved with military support for Haftar, as they fear the GNA’s connections to political Islam and the Muslim Brotherhood. Russia also allows the Wagner Group to aid Haftar in exchange for favorable strategic access to ports and other transit centers. Meanwhile, Turkey supports the GNA because of maritime oil and gas deals they have brokered. The other foreign backers have taken a more subtle approach, providing aid and diplomatic support to their preferred partner. Militarily, Turkey and Egypt have gone the farthest by approving troop deployments, though Russia also has a presence through the Wagner Group, and the UAE has conducted airstrikes for Haftar.\n\nThe GNA declared a state of emergency in Libya’s capital city of Tripoli in September 2018, less than a week after a UN cease-fire went into effect. Attempts to create a unity government failed as the HoR and the GNA continued to compete for power. Both governing bodies created their own central banks [PDF] and consolidated control over oil fields. In May 2018, French President Emmanuel Macron convened a meeting between Haftar, GNA leader Fayez Seraj, and parliamentary leaders to discuss ending the conflict and future elections. Though the rival groups agreed to hold elections in December 2018, UN Special Envoy to Libya Ghassan Salame said elections would be postponed until spring 2019.\n\nMeanwhile, rival armed groups, including militias loyal to Haftar and the GNA’s security forces, continued fighting over access to and control of Libya’s National Oil Corporation (NOC) and regional oil fields. In December 2018, the NOC closed Libya’s largest oil field, El Sharara, due to security concerns; Haftar later declared the field secure and ready to restart operations but cut off all oil fields when fighting resumed.\n\nOn April 3, 2019, Haftar upended peace efforts by launching a campaign to take western Libya and Tripoli with the backing of Egypt, the UAE, France, and Russia. Haftar’s LNA made fast progress until stalling on the outskirts of Tripoli, achieving only small gains over the next year. At the GNA’s request, Turkey sent troops to Tripoli in early 2020 to reinforce the city’s defense and increase the size of the force ahead of the GNA counteroffensive. Meanwhile, the UAE conducted airstrikes in support of Haftar. UN-led mediation efforts made little progress [PDF] as the war escalated and civilian casualties rose through May 2020. With Turkish support, the GNA-aligned forces achieved a breakthrough in June, pushing the LNA back to Sirte. Tensions escalated when Egypt warned that Sirte was its “red line,” and in July, authorized the deployment of troops to help prevent the GNA from taking the city.\n\nIn August 2020, violence eased as the GNA declared a unilateral cease-fire. Haftar ended an oil blockade shortly after, paving the way for a nationwide cease-fire signed in October. The 2020 cease-fire established the 5+5 Joint Military Commission (JMC), comprised of officers from the GNA and LNA, to work on implementing the cease-fire and other security issues. The JMC made progress, but it has struggled to achieve the withdrawal of foreign fighters. Most importantly, despite a lack of trust and a faltering cease-fire, levels of violence remained low following the 2020 truce, allowing for a reopening of political dialogue.\n\nImproved security allowed Libya to hold its first vote in five years in May 2019, but turnout totaled only 38 percent across the nine municipalities where local elections occurred. Dozens of other municipalities held staggered elections from 2019 to 2021, delayed by violence and the pandemic. UN-led talks also established a roadmap for parliamentary and presidential elections to be held on December 24, 2021. As part of this plan, the Libyan Political Dialogue Forum (LPDF) formed a provisional government, the Government of National Unity (GNU), in March 2021 to unify the GNA and HoR in preparation for national elections. The LPDF appointed Abdulhamid al-Dbeibah as prime minister and Mohamed al-Menfi, representing the eastern faction, president. The HoR almost unanimously approved the new government’s cabinet, and Seraj’s GNA and the eastern-based parliament ceded power to the new GNU.\n\nOn September 21, 2021, the HoR dashed hopes of elections when it passed a no-confidence motion against the GNU. Dbeibah called on Libyans to protest the HoR decision and reneged on his promise not to run in the election, declaring his candidacy along with Haftar and Qaddafi’s son, the other prominent candidates. However, the High National Electoral Commission indefinitely postponed the election just days before the planned vote as tensions arose over candidate eligibility and presidential and parliamentary powers. The HoR called for the dissolution of the GNU, arguing its mandate expired on December 24, but Dbeibah refused to step down and said his government would remain in place until elections are held. In March 2022, the HoR approved a new cabinet with Fathi Bashagha as prime minister, effectively setting up a rival government based in Sirte.\n\nThe formation of rival governments reignited struggles for control over territory and resources. In March 2022, Haftar’s forces seized the GNU Benghazi headquarters and cut off access to oil and gas fields to deprive the GNU of revenue since it refused to give Bashagha access to state funds for his government’s budget. With no prospect of a political solution and the HoR facing protests, Bashagha entered Tripoli and tried to install his government. He failed, and fighting broke out in the capital between rival government forces in August following months of skirmishes.\n\nRecent Developments\n\nConditions improved in late 2022, but tensions remained high as the HoR solidified its institutions and political negotiations fractured. As UN-led talks failed to gain traction, the HoR embarked on its own path, passing a constitutional amendment in March 2023 that could lay the ground for elections and proposing to appoint a new national executive committee to replace the GNC and HoR.\n\nThe HoR has also engaged in talks with the High State Council (HSC), a committee established in 2015 to advise the GNA and HoR, forming a 6+6 joint council to create a roadmap for elections. In June 2023, that body recommended forming a new interim government in preparation for elections. While Haftar said he supports the proposal, Dbeibah, who has consolidated power after two years at the helm in Tripoli, rebuked any effort to form a new transitional governing body, insisting his government will continue to serve as the “interim” government until elections.\n\nDbeibah’s nephew and Haftar’s son have engaged in direct talks in Egypt on a separate plan to see Dbeibah stay in power but concede some ministries to Haftar. Those talks follow the May 2023 replacement of Bashagha with finance minister Osama Hamad as the eastern-based prime minister. The various peace talk tracks have each seen some progress, but low-scale violence persists, and any deal that does not have strong support from Dbeibah and Haftar is likely to cause further polarization.\n\nComplicating peace prospects, Libya has also been drawn back into regional disputes over oil deposits and arms deals. In October 2022, the GNA signed an agreement with Turkey to begin oil and gas exploration off its coast, and in January 2023, it signed a deal with Italian company ENI to increase oil and gas output. Greece and Egypt have disputed maritime borders with Libya and condemned Turkey’s moves, raising the possibility of confrontation in the Mediterranean. To the dismay of the GNU, a Libyan court suspended the deal with Turkey in January 2023. A member of the Organization for Petroleum Exporting Companies (OPEC), Libya’s oil revenues constitute more than 80 percent of its total exports. As armed groups continue to fight over oil fields and restrict production, concerns have also increased over whether the country can support itself economically.\n\nLeftover weaponry from prior conflicts has turned Libya into an “open supermarket” for arms, according to the former head of the UN Support Mission in Libya, which has fueled both internal political struggles and neighboring conflicts. Haftar has been accused of supplying weapons to the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in Sudan’s civil war, putting Haftar on the opposing side of his ally Egypt in that conflict.\n\nOn September 10, 2023, Storm Daniel hit northeastern Libya, triggering catastrophic flooding. More than eleven thousand people were reported dead, with many more missing in the port city of Derna, where the flooding caused nearby dams to burst. The country’s political turmoil hampered rescue efforts and the delivery of humanitarian aid, prompting hundreds of protestors in Derna to demand government accountability. As the hope for locating survivors diminished, relief efforts turned to tackle the worsening humanitarian crisis with more than forty thousand Libyans displaced, mounting medical supply shortages, and contaminated drinking water, raising fears of possible disease outbreaks.\n\nMigration issues also continue to present grave humanitarian concerns. Libya’s porous borders and fractured security situation make it a top transit country for people trying to reach Europe, with smugglers sending migrants across the Mediterranean in unsafe, overcrowded vessels. The business has contributed to the nearly thirty thousand people who have died or disappeared crossing the sea since 2014. In 2023, the number of deaths and disappearances on the Central Mediterranean route increased compared to the previous five years. According to the UN, Libyan forces have also committed significant human rights abuses against migrants detained in Libyan facilities, including forced labor, extortion, torture, and sexual assault. A mass grave containing the bodies of sixty-five migrants was discovered in March 2024, leading the UN human rights chief to launch a full investigation. Meanwhile, the sex and labor trafficking of migrants and asylum-seekers at the hands of criminal networks, militia groups, government officials, and private employers remains largely unchecked.",

Debretsion has strongly criticized Getachew for what he perceives as the slow and ineffective enforcement of this agreement. He has not only called for the dissolution of the TIA but has actively sought to delegitimize Getachew’s authority.\n\nTensions reached a boiling point in mid-March when some members of the Tigray Defense Forces (TDF loyal to Debretsion seized key locations in Tigray, including the regional radio station and mayor’s office in Mekelle, as well as towns along the Eritrean border.\n\nGetachew, in response, took decisive steps by suspending three TDF commanders and appealing for federal intervention.

        "description": "Tensions in Ethiopia’s Tigray region have escalated significantly, threatening to reignite conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea and destabilize the Horn of Africa. The Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) is embroiled in a power struggle with the Tigray Interim Administration (TIA), appointed by Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed in 2023 as part of the Pretoria Agreement that ended the civil war from 2020 to 2022. This internal division has led to violent clashes, with TPLF-aligned forces seizing control of key areas in Tigray. Eritrea is reportedly supporting these dissident factions of the TPLF, potentially undermining Ethiopia’s ambitions for sea access. The situation is further exacerbated by the incomplete implementation of the Pretoria Agreement, including the Tigray Defense Forces’ disarmament and the continued presence of Eritrean troops in Ethiopia. These developments have raised fears of a potential war between Ethiopia and Eritrea, which could have far-reaching consequences for regional stability and humanitarian conditions.\n\nBackground\n\nBetween 2020 and 2022, Ethiopia fought a war with militants from its northernmost region of Tigray, then under the control of the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front (TPLF). The conflict was one of the deadliest in recent history and drew international attention for alleged war crimes, human rights abuses, and ethnic cleansing. The war formally ended in November 2022, but Tigray was left in ruins, and its capital was turned over to the federal government.\n\nFor decades before the war, the TPLF was a dominant political force in Ethiopia. Between 1991 and his death in 2012, Tigrayan soldier-politician Meles Zenawi governed Ethiopia as an autocracy with the backing of a TPLF-dominated coalition. The Zenawi regime oversaw rapid development and increased Ethiopia’s international prominence, but his government marginalized ethnic groups, including the Oromo and Amhara, to solidify government power. Additionally, Ethiopia was at war with Eritrea [PDF] from 1998 to 2000. The war was followed by a nearly twenty-year-long frozen conflict, effectively paralyzing both countries politically and economically.\n\nThe TPLF continued to govern Ethiopia after Zenawi’s passing until 2018, when protests, especially among the Oromo population, prompted the government to appoint Abiy Ahmed Ali as the next prime minister. Abiy, born in Oromia, was heralded by international actors and Ethiopians as the country’s new hope for peace and ethnic harmony. Early in his premiership, he promised to heal broken trust between the country’s ethnic groups and began to roll back restrictions on certain political freedoms. In 2019, he received the Nobel Peace Prize for negotiating an end to Ethiopia’s two-decade standoff with Eritrea.\n\nBy 2020, ethnic relations within Ethiopia began to deteriorate once again. Repeated delays of long-promised national elections and the June 2020 extension of Abiy’s first term provoked indignation from the TPLF. The Tigray State Council’s decision to hold local elections in defiance of federal orders further inflamed tensions. These elections ultimately solidified the TPLF’s control over the region. On November 4, 2020, Abiy accused Tigrayan troops of attacking a federal military camp in the Tigrayan capital, Mekelle, and ordered Ethiopian National Defense Force (ENDF) troops to move north. This marked the beginning of a military campaign known as the Mekelle Offensive, which quickly escalated as the ENDF advanced deeper into Tigray, and the Tigray Defense Force, or TDF, ramped up their response.\n\nAbiy initially framed the offensive as a targeted operation against TPLF leadership. A communications blackout at the outset of the conflict shuttered coverage of ground conditions. However, by December 2020, media and UN officials began sounding the alarm about the improper treatment of civilians, predominantly ethnic Tigrayans. Ethiopia’s neighbor and former adversary, Eritrea, intervened militarily on the side of the Ethiopian government. After months of denying their presence, Abiy admitted that Eritrean troops were fighting in Tigray in spring 2021.\n\nIn 2021, the United States characterized the war as an ethnic cleansing against Tigrayans, and some NGOs raised concerns about the potential of genocide. In March 2021, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights announced a joint probe with the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC) to investigate alleged abuses and rights violations in Tigray, although the impartiality and accuracy of the report [PDF] were called into question following its presentation at the United Nations.\n\nTigrayan forces retook the regional capital of Mekelle from the ENDF in June 2021. A month later, Addis Ababa announced the results of a national parliamentary election, which Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed won in a landslide. The TPLF boycotted the election, and opposition leadership in parliament accused the Abiy government of banning poll observers in some states. Later, in the summer of 2021, Abiy called on all capable citizens to join the war against Tigrayan forces as the conflict began to spill over into the Afar and Amhara regions, growing closer to Addis Ababa. In November 2021, Tigrayan troops and allied Oromo militants marched within eighty-five miles of the capital but were forced back north by ENDF forces.\n\nThe conflict divided Ethiopia along ethnic lines. Oromia’s regional army, the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA), allied itself with the TPLF, while militants from Amhara and Afar, regions bordering Tigray, sided with federal forces. In 2021, the government declared a state of emergency in Amhara after a series of attacks against ethnic Oromos. Similar bouts of ethnic violence occurred in Oromia, where local militants began attacking Amhara-majority enclaves in March 2021, forcing thousands to flee. As the war intensified, the attacks worsened. In June 2022, more than two hundred Amhara were murdered in Oromia. By July, several hundred had been killed in massacres across the region.\n\nAfter a series of failed efforts to negotiate a settlement to the civil war, the TPLF and the Ethiopian central government signed a cessation of hostilities agreement on November 2, 2022, in Pretoria, South Africa. Followed by implementation negotiations in Nairobi, the agreement promised to disarm Tigrayan troops, hand control of Tigray to the Ethiopian federal government, end the Mekelle Offensive, and permit full humanitarian access to Tigray.\n\nNotably, the Pretoria Agreement does not explicitly mention Eritrea, nor were Eritrean representatives present at the negotiations. This omission raised international concern that Eritrean troops would continue operations within Ethiopia despite the agreement between the Ethiopian government and TPLF. Indeed, displaced Tigrayans reported in January 2023 that Amhara and Eritrean soldiers continued to occupy Western Tigray. The Amhara continued to contest ownership of the area, and the federal government eventually announced that the political fate of the territory would be decided in a referendum. As of early 2025, however, the referendum is yet to take place.\n\nThe effects of the war have been devastating. In 2021 alone, 5.1 million Ethiopians became internally displaced, a record for the most people internally displaced in any country in any single year at the time. Thousands fled to Sudan and other neighboring countries. By the time the Pretoria Agreement took effect, the Tigray War had killed approximately 600,000 people.\n\nDespite the signing of the Pretoria Agreement, instability and violence continued to characterize Ethiopia throughout 2023. In April, the central government announced that all regional security forces—permitted to operate under the national constitution—would be integrated into the national security services. The decision was largely seen as an attempt to degrade the autonomy of the regions, and it sparked violent protests and militia activity across the country. Resistance proliferated in Amhara, forcing the ENDF, in a reversal of alliances, to spend much of the year fighting against regional special forces and a powerful militia known as the Fano, as both groups refused to disband and join the national army. Operations also continued against the OLA, despite several rounds of unsuccessful peace talks.\n\nIn 2023, Ethiopia and Eritrea reignited political hostilities, marking a troubling shift in their relationship. Tensions flared between the two countries when Abiy began signaling Ethiopia’s intention to secure a Red Sea port, and, with it, participation in international maritime trade. Ethiopia has been landlocked since the 1990s when the coastal region of Eritrea broke away to form an independent state following a decades-long war of independence. Explaining the importance of sea access for Ethiopia, Abiy commented, “By 2030 [the population of Ethiopia] will be one hundred and fifty million … A population of one hundred and fifty million can’t live in a geographic prison.” The comments were met with widespread concern as a prelude to military action against Eritrea.\n\nIn January 2024, Ethiopia signed a memorandum of understanding with Somaliland (a semi-independent state in Somalia), in which it promised to recognize the latter’s independence in exchange for access to a nineteen-kilometer-long stretch of coastline on the Gulf of Aden. Somalia, which has never recognized the independence of Somaliland, threatened war in response.\n\nInsurgencies in Oromia and Amhara intensified in 2024, further challenging the federal government’s authority. In Amhara, the Fano militia launched offensives against major cities for the first time in nearly a year, including Bahir Dar, the region’s capital. Fighting similarly escalated in Oromia, where the government intensified its efforts against the OLA as violence spread ever closer to Addis Ababa. Perhaps most worryingly, conflict returned to Tigray for the first time since the end of the civil war in 2022, signaling a failure to enforce the disarmament provisions laid out by the Pretoria Agreement.\n\nRecent Developments\n\nRecent events have further destabilized Tigray, raising fears of a return to civil war. In August 2024, the TPLF excluded Getachew Reda, the interim regional administrator for the federally-appointed Tigrayan Interim Administration (TIA), from its fourteenth Congress. Getachew responded by declaring the gathering “null and void,” before being permanently expelled from the TPLF in September, along with several senior TIA officials.\n\nAmid growing tensions in Tigray, Prime Minister Ahmed’s government won a series of political victories. In December, it revealed that the Oromia regional government had signed a peace deal with a breakaway faction of the OLA. Then, in December, the Turkish government announced it had mediated a productive discussion between Ethiopia and Somalia, and that the two countries would thereafter recognize, as per the Ankara Declaration, “the potentially diverse benefits that could be derived from Ethiopia’s assured access to and from the sea, whilst respecting the territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Somalia.” Ethiopia and Somalia formally restored diplomatic ties in January 2025.\n\nSince then, however, urgent challenges have emerged for the Ethiopian government. In Tigray, federal authority is quickly shrinking. The TPLF has taken effective control of the region’s two largest cities, Mekelle and Ad Gudan, after a series of skirmishes with federal forces that have killed, injured, and displaced thousands of civilians. The violence threatens to escalate into a regional war between Ethiopia and Eritrea. The two countries have traded diplomatic accusations in recent months, and now appear to have mobilized forces to the border. Eritrea fears an emboldened Abiy may look to seize Assab and Massawa, two ports along the Eritrean coast, in his quest for sea access. Meanwhile, Ethiopia believes Eritrea will capitalize on instability in Tigray to launch an offensive into the region.\n\nEthiopia’s destabilization holds significant security implications for the Horn of Africa, a region that is facing armed conflict in Somalia, Sudan, and South Sudan. Ethiopia, Egypt, and Sudan have been locked in a political dispute since 2011 over Ethiopia’s construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, a hydroelectric dam on the Nile River that restricts the northern flow of freshwater. During the Tigray War, tensions were also reignited between Ethiopia and Sudan over the fertile border region of Al Fashaga, where governance rights have been contested since the early 1900s. The dispute was exacerbated by Sudan’s support for the TPLF and persists to this day.",

        "description": "Domestic and international deployments of U.S. military personnel\n\nThe military of the United States is deployed in most countries around the world, with more than 160,000 of its active-duty personnel stationed outside the United States and its territories.[1] This list consists of deployments excepting active combat deployments, including troops in Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and Somalia.[2]\n\nOutside of active combat, US personnel are typically deployed as part of several peacekeeping and classified missions, military attachés, or are part of embassy and consulate security.\n\nRationale [ edit ]\n\nStatements by U.S. military and government [ edit ]\n\nA longstanding justification for maintaining military installations worldwide for the United States is that a military presence abroad by the U.S. promotes and strengthens democracy.\n\nStatements by others [ edit ]\n\nAccording to Hermann and Kegley, military interventions have boosted democracy in other nations.[4] The majority of academics, however, concur with professor of international politics Abraham Lowenthal that American efforts to spread democracy have been \"negligible, often counterproductive, and only occasionally positive.\"[4][5][6]\n\nJoAnn Chirico believes that, as of 2014, the U.S. military presence and installations are often considered responsible for suppressing democracy in countries such as Cameroon, Chad, Ethiopia, Jordan, Kuwait, Niger, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates.\n\nIn her 1979 essay, \"Dictatorships and Double Standards\", Jeane Kirkpatrick argued that although the United States should encourage democracy, it should be understood that premature reforms may cause a backlash that could give the Communists an opportunity to take over. For this reason, she considered it legitimate to support non-communist dictatorships, adding that a successful and sustainable democratic process is likely to be a long-term process in many cases in the Third World. The essence of the so-called Kirkpatrick Doctrine is the use of selective methods to advance democracy in order to contain the wave of communism.\n\nCurrent deployments [ edit ]\n\nThe following regional tables provide detail of where personnel from six branches of the US military are currently deployed. These numbers do not include any military or civilian contractors or their dependents. Additionally, countries in which US military are engaged in active combat operations are not included. The numbers are based on the most recent United States Department of Defense statistics as of June 30, 2024.[1]\n\nAmericas [ edit ]\n\nEast Asia, Southeast Asia, and Pacific Ocean [ edit ]\n\nJurisdiction Total Army Navy USAF USMC USCG USSF Japan 52,603 2,319 21,545 12,184 16,431 21 103 Hawaii 43,844 18,115 12,273 5,364 6,435 1,497 160 South Korea 23,291 14,592 348 8,113 159 1 78 Guam 6,725 – 3,941 2,317 146 320 1 Australia 322 54 79 158 24 2 5 Singapore 227 17 167 21 12 10 – other 439 128 52 65 181 13 – Total 127,451 35,225 38,405 28,222 23,388 1,864 347\n\nEurope [ edit ]\n\nUS military bases in Germany in 2014\n\nJurisdiction Total Army Navy USAF USMC USCG USSF Germany 34,949 21,338 393 12,607 410 10 191 Italy 12,456 4,078 3,472 4,822 62 1 21 United Kingdom 10,063 216 273 9,452 52 14 56 Spain 3,586 28 3,129 397 31 1 – Belgium 1,032 532 85 378 34 – 3 Netherlands 415 118 30 223 13 30 1 Greece 398 13 351 27 7 – – Poland 312 176 94 32 10 – – Portugal 230 5 45 163 16 1 – Romania 145 27 99 10 9 – – other 636 144 68 172 246 5 1 Total 64,222 26,675 8,039 28,283 890 62 273\n\nWest Asia, Central Asia, South Asia, Africa, and Indian Ocean [ edit ]\n\nUnspecified [ edit ]\n\nJurisdiction Total Army Navy USAF USMC USCG USSF Overseas\n\n(incl. unincorporated US territories) 13,795 4,317 12 1,173 8,253 4 36\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]",
